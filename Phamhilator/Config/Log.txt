		"Body" : "<p>Jesus knew God's earthly temple, a shadow of things to come would be destroyed and that He would build IT up again in three days (John 2:19). His Church is His Risen Body. He IS The Rock, not a stumbling block to the blinded (Romans 14:13, Isaiah 57:14, Revelation 2:14,Matthew 23:13) crushing a mortal blow to the enemy.  Those that live are rooted and grounded in and upon Him. </p>\n\n<p>Those in darkness are sent (or called) to come to Him. He is the oil, their hearts are the lamp.  The Light of the World shines out in the darkness and brings the Children Home, where there is no more night. (Matthew 25)</p>\n\n<p>The gates of hell shall not prevail against He Who Lives to tell of the Glory of God, of He Who does not fail.  Darkness and death do fall, Jesus is Risen, the Morning Dawn. All things together worked for those that Love God.   He Loves us First and Best and Last.</p>\n\n<p>The gates of hell cannot prevail against the city of Zion. That city has twelve gates and healing for all the nations, those that are washed and ready enter in, the gates are not shut any longer.(Revelation 21:21)  Jesus is the door, the Temple that cannot be opened or closed by anyone but Him.  Those that hear Him know Him follow Him enter by Him. Those that do not can not. </p>\n\n<p>The church is Built in the city of Zion, filled with spirits made right with God through Jesus.  He is the way the truth and the life.  The gates of hell fell when Christ entered it. (1 Peter 3:19)  Though He was destroyed and taken down and killed, because He is the Rightful Heir, the Son of God Most High, death could not keep Him. The captives come to their senses and are drawn out of this death and despair.(2 Timothy 2:26) They Laid down the old the former of self and put on the new, as ones born Holy and Held Together.(Ephesians 4:24-26, Colossians 3:10, John 15)</p>\n\n<p>He fought(fights/rules) through all time and makes it this Way. This world is His Footstool and his enemies are under His Feet. He sits with the Father and all is complete. )Luke 20:43) </p>\n\n<p>Is He Crowned now, or was He Crowned then, or will it be so in the end?  I think always He IS and to each He does give the right become the Children of Light. (John 1:12)  He Speaks and they listen, pulled out of the dark. (John 10)</p>\n\n<p>We are pressed and crushed in these vessels of dust, but filled with His Spirit, The Light of the Lost.(John 6:29 John 8:12)) Ashes for Beauty.(Isaiah 61:3) Purified by Fire and Dressed for the Feast. (1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18, Psalm 66:10-12 Isaiah 48:9-11)  Baked and Built up without adding of yeast. The afflicted are saved and fruitful at last. Grown in His Grace, no longer bound. </p>\n\n<p>Though hell would reach, His Hand Holds Her Firm. This Church His Bride Secured By His Word. Two become one. A woman encircles a man as never seen before in this land. (Jeremiah 31:22, Psalm 85:10)</p>\n\n<p>(I see it/understand it in allegory and He helps me live it temporally...easier said than done and best done as we Live. inspired by Him... IN This Life That He Gives through the Death that He Takes and Destroys in the Day. He is doing this, has done this and will do this, as He IS Faithful) He Makes the Faithful \"faith full\" By His Name and Rightful Claim of Them. (Hebrews 12:2)</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>For basic organizational purposes, compressing the folders on a per-client basis\u2014or per-project basis\u2014simply makes it easier to reference the material later on. I generally divide up my client work folders between the generic, sundry stuff like notes and invoices. And then have code and related assets in another folder.</p>\n\n<p>I use Mac OS X and what I like to do is create an encrypted disk image using Apple\u2019s built-in \u201CDisk Utility\u201D for each client so I can safely take those files, archive them somewhere and not have to worry about prying eyes checking out file contents. Just create an image that is big enough to hold your files, choose an encrypting method\u2014I use 256-bit AES\u2014and create the disk. Then I store these images on an external hard drive I toss in a closet that is essentially my \u201Ccold storage\u201D for old client work; out of sight and out of mind. With hard drive prices getting cheaper, I have two of these project/client/work drives that are essentially mirrored backup copies of each other; I might not want to deal with these files but if I have to dust them off years down the line I want to make sure the data is recoverable in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of archiving is you ensure that file metadata such as access and modification dates/times are retained. This might not seem like anything significant to you, but perhaps in the future you want to create a nice portfolio of your work and want to make sure you get the timeline right? Well, by having all of the files archived you are assured that none of the files had access or modification time/date stamps mucked around with either accidentally or intentionally. Also on the legal side of things, let\u2019s say something requires you to prove work you did was done a certain date/time? Having an archive with date/time stamps that are frozen you are in better shape when engaging in the nonsense some clients might engage in to blame you for something you might not have done.</p>\n\n<p>Performance-wise, I basically think that keeping unwanted, unneeded files on your \u201Clive system\u201D taking up space is a bad use of resources. My main system disk is about 50GB to 60GB in size. I only ever keep active client work on that. If I were to keep all client projects on my main hard drive, I would have 200GB to 300GB of dead weight just sitting there. Removing it from them main drive makes it easier for me to perform backups of the main hard drive. And it\u2019s made it easier and quicker to recover a backup if my system drive fails.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I've encountered a subset of users in my subreddit that are interested in helping us curate content by reporting submissions that don't belong, but instead of using the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reporting\" rel=\"nofollow\">reporting</a> feature, I've seen some of the following from various users:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Downvote the submission.</li>\n<li>Publicly berate the submitter in the comments.</li>\n<li>Ask the moderators to remove the post in the comments.</li>\n<li>Post a link to the user's profile in <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/spam\" rel=\"nofollow\">/r/spam</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Some of these responses are appropriate, others not so much -- but even among those that are, I would prefer that they happen in conjunction with the user reporting the post to the subreddit moderators.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is reporting useful?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Reporting is a reddit-wide feature that highlights the reported post to moderators of the subreddit it is in.  If a post is reported directly to the subreddit moderators, we can take action to prevent future misconduct at the subreddit level. We can monitor the offending user, block spammy domains so the user can't create new accounts to continue spamming, etc.  We even have some automation in place that escalates notifications to moderators after a certain number of reports on a post, and automatically removes a post after a much higher threshold.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Users seem to be interested in reporting bad content to <em>somebody</em>, but either don't know the established procedure in our subreddit (trope: <em>nobody <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/all/search?q=%22read%20the%20sidebar%22&sort=relevance&t=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">reads the sidebar</a></em>) or, in the case of spammers, supersede us in favor of the script at /r/spam.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure that there's a solution here that can be applied in a single stroke, but I am interested in changing the culture of our subreddit so that users are encouraged to use the reporting feature. Is there any way I can do a better job of conveying to our users that reporting is useful to the moderators, aside from the default literature and functionality that Reddit provides?</p>",

		"Title" : "Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the w...",
		"Body" : "<p>Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the whole thing at face value, then it doesn't start at Romans 6:1, it goes back before that. 6:1 begins with a question based on what he just said, which goes back to chapter 4. Righteousness is imputed by simply believing what God says, not because of what we experience, but in spite of what is experienced (when Abraham was 99 years old and it was impossible to fulfill God's promise, he believed God anyway...in spite of what he saw/experienced, etc.), which takes us back to chapter 3 and imputed righteousness by faith (simply believing God). That then becomes the premise moving forward, faith...not experience, believing God. </p>\n\n<p>You simply believe God and take him at his word. He lists a bunch of good stuff in 5 which we receive by faith, even undoing what Adam brought. So much is this true, so great is our salvation, so sure our justification, that it might be concluded that we can do whatever we want now that we are saved and still be good with God. Hence the beginning of chapter 6...based on everything that has come before it. </p>\n\n<p>The assumption in 6 is that a Christian will not continue in sin because the Christian has been baptized into Christ's body, been put to death with Christ, put in the grave with Christ and has raised again unto new life. He uses the example of two seeds being planted into the ground together. We are challenged to believe this just like Abraham believed God could still produce seed when his body was now dead at 99 years old. He believed God even though it was hard to believe, in fact, it was contrary to his experience. \"He stumbled not at the promises of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.\" So should we be, in chapter 6 and believe that God says our flesh is dead and, as a result, we are free from sin.</p>\n\n<p>He finishes out 6 without a shadow of a doubt that the old man is dead, saying three times that we are free from sin. Then he moves into 7 with a statement followed by an analogy. He says, if you are dead (like we are in Romans 6) then we are free from the law. Just like a woman who is married to a mean old man wanted to be free from him but could not break the law. Her old man had to die for her to be free to marry the new man. Notice the law did not die, the old man did. Hence, the old man is dead and we are free from him completely (as the law ends at the grave).</p>\n\n<p>This continues perfectly in past tense language, bringing in the law as an example, using himself before Christ. This goes down to verse 14. Here he switches language to draw a point. What happens when a person tries to please God by the law? This whole argument is about a religious person under the law trying to live up to it, the harder you try the worse it gets, the more guilt you feel for failing. After verse 14 he uses himself in past tense language as if he were still a religious person trying to live up to it, wanting to be free from the power of the flesh (which was put to death in chapter 6). </p>\n\n<p>Why would he do this? Because he was the poster child of good religious guy. This is not Paul currently, this is Paul using past tense language to describe the futility of trying to please God through good works.</p>\n\n<p>In verse 24 and 25, he asks the question, \"who shall deliver me from the BODY of this death?\" he recognizes the problem is the body...the flesh...that thing which was put to death in chapter 6. He answers it... \"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" He did it, the fight is over. </p>\n\n<p>To confirm this interpretation, he continues into chapter 8 with this statement, which would seem strange if Paul, was still in the condition described in chapter 7. He says:</p>\n\n<p>Romans 8:1-8  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. <strong>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They that are in the flesh cannot please God! That's the problem with the guy in chapter 7, he was still in the flesh..so he could not please God. But 6, most of 7, and 8 all say that the Christian is not in the flesh. </p>\n\n<p>Now, think about this. If Paul existed, as a Christian, in chapter 7, then he said he could not EVER control himself. In fact, every time he tried to, he failed. He just could not do the right thing! He knew what the right thing was, but he just couldn't do it...ALL THE TIME! \"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.\" Really? Are you that way? Can you never do the right thing?</p>\n\n<p>That is not the prison on death row saying that, that is the Apostle to the gentiles. the writer of most of the books of the NT, the great Paul. </p>\n\n<p>All through the book of Romans he uses the same thought continually. It would be very strange to say that he suddenly switches and contradicts himself for about 10 verses and then goes right back to his original argument. A better thought would be that he simply used language to prove his point that a man outside of Christ who is trying to live up to a law to earn his salvation cannot do it. It is only through Christ that he has hope of pleasing God.</p>",

Wil he consider that you have been in faith because,no,He can never go against his unchanged word in Ephesians chapter 5 which He said that He will present to His father a perfect church,church without wrinkles nor spot.</p>\n\n<p>What Jesus expect from us is that we should stand in the liberty which He had set us free according to apostle paul.</p>\n\n<p>Before we go to christ for forgiveness & salvation there is an old man of sin living in us which the blood of Jesus pursuid it away by force.\nBut the point is that this man left some properties like hatred,lies,fornication,malice,lust,fight,etc in the life of the newly saved person because because the pernetration of Jesus' blood is like fire entering your house in a very hesten way to the devil,you will not wait to take every thing out of the house before you go out but rather save your life.\nBut after every thing,you will go back to the ablazed house because of some properties you left there,though some will be destroyed but some tough ones will still remain.\nThat is why the devil come back to your life to make you sin.for instance,he make you fornicate after giving your life to Christ,it means that he left that very property in your life and now he come back to remind you of it and you fall.</p>\n\n<p>The main truth here is that the presence of christ in you cannot alow the devil to come in again but some of his properties still remain in you.\nYou must not rest after receiving christ fight against those properties in you now so that you will not be denied to enter the kingdom.\nThank you.</p>",

		"Title" : "Paul is speaking to believers who have been exposed to the teachings of ...",
		"Body" : "<p>Paul is speaking to believers who have been exposed to the teachings of the church, which is that selfishness and greed is sin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Luke 16:13-17 NET</strong> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\u201D\n   The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him. But Jesus said to them, \u201CYou are the ones who justify yourselves in men\u2019s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God\u2019s sight.\n   \u201CThe law and the prophets were in force until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urged to enter it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If believers confess/agree the above is true, they are no longer \u201Dsinners\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>However, we are saints in bodies of death, bodies that crave to satisfy the natural appetites, sometimes excessively or in the wrong situation. You may want to indulge your love of rich food to the point of gluttony which may be lawfully available with money of your own. Lawful but unrighteous. You may lust after your neighbours property or wife, which are unavailable because of unlawfulness. Unlawful AND unrighteous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:21-22 NET</strong> So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>2 Corinthians 7:1 NET</strong> Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1 John 2:1-2, 5-10 NET</strong> Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. (My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous One, and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The gist of Romans 6 is that as Christians, we are dead to sin, and thus free from it. We are no longer slaves to sin, but are slaves to God and righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 6:16-18 (ESV) Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing what sin is and its consequences, you are set free. The Pharisees did not even know that their behaviour was sin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, I don't think many Christians would say that they feel very free from sin. In fact, Paul goes on in the next chapter to say that he is a slave to sin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 7:18-19 (ESV) For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This kind of language doesn't sound very \"free\". If he says that Christians are \"slaves of the one whom you obey\", and yet he finds himself obeying the flesh, doesn't that make him a slave to sin? In what way, then, are Christians \"free\" from sin?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Walking in The Light</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scripture tells us that when we believe God wants us to conquer the giants of sin, even though we feel like ants and grasshoppers with regard to being up to the task, He will give us victory. Belief, leads to God giving us the Holy Spirit. Read Galatians 3 for details of what happens when the Spirit is given.</p>",

Luckily, Dell provides compatibility information with the cards it sells, and the Radeon 7750 is compatible. However, I've done enough research to realize that the charged price (nearly $200 with tax) is more expensive that what that type of card is usually sold for.

Obviously he can fly anything with a propeller. When I showed him this devise,and being objective and honestly blunt, he encourage me to go further. There is no one, <strong><em>repeat</em></strong>, no who can start an aircraft with this device installed but the owner and or his designee. You can leave the keys in the ignition, the cabin door unlocked, the wheal locks off and eliminate the chains on your props.I need your input! Here's my take. Must it be approved by the FAA before marketing and sales? Where do I go next? I want to test this device with some authenticity.Anybody with some dexterity and can change a light bulb, can install this devise in 30 minutes.Your comments please! </p>\n\n<p>Thank you, davidfaustin@yahoo.com</p>",

I visited my first-choice program (also in physics) around Thanksgiving of my senior year, and scheduled meetings with two PIs I wanted to work with.  The first stood me up, but the second took several hours to meet with me and show me the lab, and at the end of the visit he told me \"If you get in and want to start early, let me know and I could probably give you an RA for the summer\".  This ended up being a big help -- the visit made clear who would be better to work with, and also helped me get started with research shortly after graduating.  </p>",

		"Title" : "Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...\n...",
		"Body" : "<p>Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. (Luke 19:26, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Luke version appears to add some helpful context, so I suggest reading that chapter.  A few directions that seemed to have some sort of foundation...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Luke version of the verse comes at the end of parable about the stewardship the nobleman's servants choose while he was away.  10 servants are all given the same amount of money.  When the nobleman returns, he asks what has been done with it.\nOne man traded diligently and turned it into 10.\nAnother turned it into 5.\nBut one stashed it away in fear of the nobleman.\nAt the end, the coin he had kept is taken away from him and given to the one who gained up to 10.</p>\n\n<p>So one thought that comes forward to me is that it may relate to courage\\faith\\understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Because the descriptions in Luke emphasize that the servant did nothing because of his fear.  A fear of the nobleman as much as anything.  Because he is \"austere\" and productive.  Those who had faith went out and used it and got more.  Those who didn't lost what they they had.\nUnderstanding is a bigger picture that may fit because understanding is centered upon fear of the Lord (e.g. Prov 1:7)... which would then really put the Matthew 13:12 into more context coming from:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 11He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. (Mat 13:10-11, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A second avenue of consideration comes from the words introducing the whole parable...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. (Luke 19:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The parable in Luke suggests that the nobleman <em>expected</em> gains from trading.  And his criticism was that the servant could have at least gotten some gain just by putting it in the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Because His point here is that the Kingdom isn't immediately coming, it follows that this is a message to them of what they should be doing going forward.  Not keeping their light hidden, but going forth in service and evangelism as He had displayed to them.  That being fully happy to sit on one's faith feeling secure suggests maybe one doesn't have the faith in Jesus\\God, the repentance of putting oneself first, that such faith would be.</p></li>\n<li><p>A third connection may start in the situation just before the parable in Luke 19, and may have motivated it.  Zacchaeus the tax collector was rich.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. (Luke 19:7, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is given just after Luke 18:18-27, where Jesus speaks of how very hard it is for the rich people to enter Heaven, being harder than passing a camel through the eye of a needle.  So could this verse\\parable also serve to remind us not to look on men by what they have, but by who they are?  That we must be careful not to judge men by their appearance, by who they are financially, but by what they do.  If nothing else, a reminder at least that men of any class can be saved, and does deserve real effort from believers as well.  And in Matthew 13:8, it does echo some of the same leadin, saying some brought forth an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p></li>\n<li><p>And one final connection that really catches me perhaps most...the idea that if you fight to hold onto what you cannot keep (your life), you lose even it.  If you give up your life to Him,  then you life a life with purpose now, and life everlasting to come. I believe Paul or Peter says something very similar to this in one of their letters, but I cannot find it unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>The servant thinks he has held onto something. He has, by his reasoning, seemingly made himself safe from failure.  But he held onto what was never his to begin with (the coin that the nobleman had given him, in the Luke verse).  Echoed in the verse</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. (Mat 16:25, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of the four, the riches connection perhaps makes me the most unsettled.  The support noted in Matthew doesn't seem solid, and nothing else in the surrounding context there seems to supports it.  But maybe the failing is on me to be secured in the message of not judging by appearance that is certainly given other places in the Bible (James 2, John 7, Luke 15, etc).\nBut, all four messages seem to have some support to them.  And perhaps tie together in the end.  But, regardless, I hope I didn't detour your question too much, haven't ENTIRELY talked your ears off, and have added some helpful thoughts.  Thanks for your time :-)</p>",

We've grown quite a bit lately, and this is in fact down from 11% a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n<h1>Data Scrutiny</h1>\n\n<p>Now, admittedly, I don't know how good that data is. They infer it based on cookies and such, as far as I understand it, so it's definitely possible that it's not that bad, or that it's worse. It's also worth noting that Quantcast looks at unique visitors to make these estimates, and not, of course, unique <em>posters</em>. One can infer the problem, but realistically I'm looking for more gender-balance in posters, and visitors is simply a side-effect.</p>\n\n<p>I say this all not because I doubt the data, and it is in fact more than lined up with what I've experienced on the site, but I want to make it clear what my evidence is actually supporting.</p>\n\n<h1>Question</h1>\n\n<p>How can I attract more female contributors to the site?</p>\n\n<h1>Hindrances</h1>\n\n<p>As most of us know, women don't currently hold a nearly-fair (not to make this political or anything) power in most businesses, and startups are pretty similar. That said, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-blank/its-about-women-running-s_b_6517516.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">there does seem to be</a> a \"revolution\" of sorts going on, and <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-20/women-who-run-tech-startups-are-catching-up\" rel=\"nofollow\">we're seeing a lot more</a> women in lead positions in startups.</p>\n\n<h1>Brainstorming</h1>\n\n<p>The best idea I've thought of so far is to reach out to some local predominantly female networking groups and ask them to post a link to us on their website. I can do that, but I don't know whether that will really raise the percentages or not. I'll probably do it anyway, since marketing is important to us now regardless, but I'd appreciate some way that was a bit less granular than that.</p>",

The db design gives good flexibility, but one trade off is the ability to draw lots of related information in just one or two queries.</p>\n\n<p>A better way might be to kill those extra queries by stripping out the term columns displayed in the post list (but you would lose the various sorting, limiting, etc. tools that the wordpress list gives, though you could build your own filters, sorting, etc. in as wanted) using the <code>manage_*_posts_columns</code> filter.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I'm facing a new Enterprise Project in Java about data migration. \nI have did one of them in the past, now I want to do a better work and I think I need your considerations.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's me explain the problem:\nI have a lot of DB tables without any logical wire. So in the most of the cases i need to perform a huge logic in the java application for build the correct results.\nIn past I have tested some advices, but in the end i used a lot of HashMap for store in memory the entries retrieved from db and perform the logic I wanted. I was really lucky because the entries were not much for the memory machine.</p>\n\n<p>The question you maybe you think now is: why you need to store all the entries into hashMap?</p>\n\n<p>Example: I have TABLE1 and i need to perform a logic to all the entries. So i have an HashMap with original data taken from db (key: the id of the table, value: the entry POJO) and they can be retrieved by a sequence of queries without load all on memory.\nThe second HashMap contains the modified data sets of the TABLE 1.\nThen I have TABLE 2 to perform another logic but I need the first modified data sets to perform other task. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end I must necessarily have in memory all the HashMap that contains the modified data sets for do all the logic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I searched a lot on the internet to see if you can put a caching mechanism, but I am very confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I would need is an intelligent algorithm that saves me the entries of HashMap on disk in case of need, but it should be fast enough to recover data when I need</strong>. Another alternative would be to save the changed data on db and use a massive amount of queries, \nbut I would avoid it because the results that interest me will not be saved to the database</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be appreciated, Thank you all!</p>",

A crack in between an oil gallery and a coolant passage either in the engine block or the cylinder head(s). There could be some other reasons but it has been my experience that if you have oil in the water you have a serious problem because oil pressure is higher than coolant pressure except with a hot engine that is turned off and in that case you'll have some water in the oil as well but if you have a crack in one or both of the heads above the coolant level (with the engine off) then only a trace amount of moisture will cross over and will usually be evaporated by engine temps. Take my advice, drive em like you stole em and when they won't take anymore scrap em</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Before my question let me briefly describe a simplified version of the dynamical system I'm working with. Suppose that I have a density function $m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, that describes the abundance of some quantity in a vector space $\\Omega = [a,b]^{n}$. Now suppose that the density at each point in vector space changes over time, with a rate that may be dependent on the presence/absence of density at every other point in space</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\partial_{t}m(\\boldsymbol{x},t) = m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)F(\\boldsymbol{x},?),\n$$</p>\n\n<p>where $F$ might be something like</p>\n\n<p>$$\nF(\\boldsymbol{x},?) = \\int_{\\Omega} m(\\boldsymbol{y},t) k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}) \\; d\\boldsymbol{y}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>i.e. a function of the focal point of interest $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and all other different points $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in vector space, where $k$ is some kind of kernal(?). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: \nWhat notation should I use to refer to the state of the system over the whole space? What should replace my question mark in $F(\\boldsymbol{x},?)$, should it be $F(\\boldsymbol{x},m)$, or maybe $F(\\boldsymbol{x},\\Omega)$, or something else? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: \nI have an extended part to this question that I'm not even really sure how to explain. Suppose I now have multiple dynamical systems like the one just described, and a second 'higher order' density function $M(?,t)$, that describes the abundance of each dynamical system in some other kind of space. What would the notation for that look like? How would I refer to a particular dynamical system (i.e. the question mark again), what would the space be, etc.? Essentially, I'm interested in whether I could formulate a dynamical equation that is analogous to a hyperbolic PDE, but one in which the flux of the density $M$ is no longer defined by a finite system of ODEs, but by an infinite number of PDEs. </p>\n\n<p>PS I apologise if the first question is stupid, and the second question doesn't make any sense. I don't really have any formal mathematical training, but I'm desperate to get to grips with this kind maths for possible use in my PhD. Any advice or links would be much appreciated. </p>",

The purely functional subset of a language like Haskell or ML can't get data from the outside world but any language for practical programming has a mechanism for inserting data from the outside world into the purely functional subset. In Haskell this is done very carefully but in ML you can do this when ever you want.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are no variables in the code</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is pretty much true but don't confuse this with the idea that nothing can be named. You name useful expressions all the time and constantly reuse them. Also both ML and Haskell, every lisp I have tried, and hybrids like scala, all have a means of creating variables. They just are not commonly used. And again the purely functional subsets of such languages don't have them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can merely \"copy\" from the already data or currently calculated\n  data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can preform calcultion by reduction to normal form. The best thing to do is probably to go write programs in a functional language to see how they do in fact preform calculations.</p>\n\n<p>For instance \"sum [1..1000]\" is not a calculation I want to preform but it is quite handily done by Haskell. We gave it a small expression that had meaning to us and haskell gave us out the corresponding number. So it defiantly preforms calculation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If data structures are supposed to remain as they are (immutable), how the hell does someone add a new item in a list?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don't add a new item to a list, you create a new list out of the old one. Because the old one can't be mutated it is perfectly safe to use it in the new list, or where ever else you want. Much more data can be safely shared in this schema.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the point in having a program that can't get new data? Say you\n  have a sensor attached to your computer that wants to feed data to the\n  program. Would that mean that we can't store the incoming data\n  anywhere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as user input goes, any practical programming language has a way of getting user input. This happens. However there is a fully functional subset of these languages that you write most of your code in and you reap the advantages in this way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is functional programming good for machine learning in that case?\n  Since machine learning builds from the assumption of updating the\n  program's \"perception\" of things - thus storing new data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would be the case for active learning but most machine learning I have worked with (I work as a code monkey in a machine learning group and have done so for a few years) has a one time learning process where all the training data is loaded in at once. But for active learning you can't do things 100% purely functionally. You are going to have to read in some data from the outside world.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At first, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription: In Feynman diagrams we have a lot of Green's functions connected by some rules, the Feynman rules. Actually, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription is more related to the Green's function. The prescription is responsible for a choice in the boundary conditions (asymptotic behaviour). We may put this $i \\epsilon$ inside the expression $(\\omega + i \\epsilon)^2$ or $(\\omega - i \\epsilon)^2$. The first is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Retarded_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">retarded Green's function</a>, the second is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Advanced_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">advanced Green's function</a>.  This choices of boundary condition are related to some adapted Feynman's rules. Calculating things in this prescriptions is not manifest relativistically and not so compact. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Feynman_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Feynman Green's function</a> is the best for doing calculations and very natural.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's be more general. This prescriptions are aroused when we have operators like this:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n(H-E)G(t)=\\delta(t)\n$$</p>\n\n<p>We want to find an expression for $G(t)$. Applying Fourier transform, we can find that</p>\n\n<p>$$\nG(x) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)} \\int d\\omega \\, \\frac{e^{-ip(t)}}{\\omega - E\\pm i\\varepsilon}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>If you see this function in complex plane, we can se that we have a cut in real axis made by eigenvalues of $H$. The prescription $\\epsilon$ determine how far we pass about the singularity $\\omega=E$. The choice of signal tell in what side.</p>\n\n<p>This precription is simply procedure to getting inverse of operators with real eigenvalues, satisfying some asymptotic behavior. </p>\n\n<p>We can interpret this $\\epsilon$ as a inverse of timelife of the signal describe by the repective Green's funciton. This is because we can identify a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Breit%E2%80%93Wigner_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">relativistic Breit\u2013Wigner distribution</a></p>\n\n<p>The untary is hold because we get $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, so the signal persist at infinite time.</p>\n\n<p>The adiabatic turn on and turn off interaction is another mathematical departure: adiabatic theorem and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_and_Low_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gell-mann and Low theorem</a>, but physically is very close to the $i\\epsilon$. Is a inverse of a caracteristic time that is send to infinity. </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>A redox reaction is any reaction in which oxidation and reduction are occurring. The word redox is a portmanteau of REDuction-OXidation. So, if we can correctly identify reduction and oxidation, we can identify redox reactants. In practice, this can be a little challenging, so I will focus first on the second part of your questions (definitions) and then go back to the reaction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ionization is any process that produces ions. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conversion of a hydrogen atom to a hydrogen ion by loss of an electron is an ionization. \n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\nSo to is the reaction of hydrochloric acid and water, which produces hydronium ions and chloride ions.\n$$\\ce{HCl + H2O -> Cl- + H3O+}$$</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation is a loss of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of hydrogen atoms to hydrogen ions is an oxidation.\n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So to is the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{2CO + O2 -> 2CO2}$$</p>\n\n<p>Note that this type of reaction is what gave us the word oxidation - compounds are reacting with oxygen and atoms end up with more oxygen atoms bound to them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reduction is a gain of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of chlorine atoms to chloride ions is a reduction.</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So too is the conversions of acetylene to ethane:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{C2H2 + 2H2 -> C2H6}$$</p>\n\n<p>Not all oxidations and reductions are ionizations. There is a simple mnemonic in English for remembering oxidation and reduction: OIL RIG (Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation and reduction happen together. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In principle we can write an equation that shows only oxidation:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>but oxidation cannot happen on its own. That electron that was lost needs to be picked up by something else. This reaction that shows only oxidation is called a \"half-reaction\" and needs to be coupled with a reduction half-reaction to show a valid chemical reaction:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\n$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$\n$$\\ce{H + Cl ->HCl}$$</p>\n\n<p>In the other examples I gave, both processes are occurring. In the oxidation of carbon monoxide, the oxygen molecules are being reduced.</p>\n\n<p>The surest way to identify oxidation and reduction (and thus redox) is to compare the oxidation states of the reactants and the products. Determining oxidation states/numbers is more complex that I want to put here, so start with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state#Determining_the_oxidation_state_or_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For the carbon monoxide example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                  reactants    products\nC                 +2           +4\nO (bonded to C)   -2           -2\nO2                0            -2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The carbon atoms are being oxidized (oxidation number increased) and the oxygen atoms in $\\ce{O2}$ are being reduced (oxidation number decreases). The oxygen atom already attached to carbon did not change its oxidation number.</p>",

		"Title" : "I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe ...",
		"Body" : "<p>I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe your confusion has confused me, too. That's great, because it made me look for the answers myself. This is just my personal guess (though grounded in some fact), but it makes a lot of sense to me, and I hope it makes sense to you, too.</p>\n\n<p>Bear with me if this is a long answer.</p>\n\n<p>First off, when we speak of the difference in the amount of electrons just before and just after a resistor, you're right: there is fundamentally no difference in the number of electrons. We know this because all the electrons (current) that comes in must be equal to the number of electrons (current) that comes out. This is one of Kirchoff's laws. Moreover, we know that matter doesn't just disappear and it isn't being converted into energy, either.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the second of Kirchoff's laws tell us that the sum of all the voltages in a circuit must be zero (so, in a simple circuit, the initial voltage from the battery minus all the voltage drops from all the resistors is zero). That tells us that something must already be happening within those resistors that has nothing to do with the battery. So that's a good start.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we should also understand that current and voltage are not the same thing. That is, if you <em>already</em> have a flowing current, that current does not have its own voltage. You might need voltage to jumpstart the flow of current, but once it's already flowing, the current exists as the jumping of one electron across ions, and each electron is only a single point -- it doesn't have voltage because it's only one point. More importantly, current flows uniformly, so there is no voltage that is being generated as it does flow. Whether it is just before or just after the resistor, the current is the same there, and it produces no voltage.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a drawing I made for you:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3hH3.png\" alt=\"Drawing of current\"></p>\n\n<p>I drew it as it really is, against the convention. Notice that, despite there being a pre-existing voltage difference between the two batteries, the distribution of electrons is uniform. So, if you tried to take a voltage difference between the first electron and the fourth electron, you get a voltage difference of zero, <em>even if they are flowing</em>, because their distribution will continue being uniform. This, I think, is the equivalent of measuring the voltage across a wire with no resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Because I think it will be useful in analyzing what happens across the resistor, I'd like to point out that the battery is the initial source of voltage. It's made so that one end is much more electronegative than the other, and that one pole has a large supply of electrons whereas the other has a large deficit. So, if you link the two ends together, the electrons flow from the less electronegative end (with more electrons) to the more electronegative end (with less electrons). In the process, the difference in electrons from pole to pole equalizes. Moreover, the chemical reactions happening inside the battery make it so that the poles (anode for negative, cathode for positive) degrade both cathode and anode -- unless it's a rechargeable battery, in which case this reaction is reversible.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn't quite spell out why there is a voltage drop across the load. If the voltage difference exists between the poles, then shouldn't the same voltage difference exist all throughout the circuit? The answer seems to be yes... but only if there is no load.</p>\n\n<p>So, we have to go back and ask, what is a voltage drop, and where does it come from?</p>\n\n<p>I think your question really is, what happens to the energy at a molecular level? It doesn't just disappear. When the voltage drops, what does it mean? If the same amount of electrons enter the resistor and then leave it, doesn't their energy stay the same?</p>\n\n<p>First, we know that if their energies are the same, then the voltmeter will tell us there is no voltage. We also know that, if their energies are the same, there is no difference between the two points. And finally, if their energies are the same, we know that no energy was lost, and therefore, no work was taken out of the system.</p>\n\n<p>But we <em>do</em> know that work was taken out of the system, and we can see the voltmeter giving us a reading. But if the number of electrons is the same across the resistor, then there <strong>must</strong> be energy being lost. But, where did that energy come from?</p>\n\n<p>We go back to what voltage is -- it is the amount of energy per unit charge. One unit of charge is the electron. So voltage is just the measure of how much energy each electron carries. There are two separate energies in the electron -- its rest energy and its momentum energy. Its rest energy is constant, but its momentum energy is definitely not.</p>\n\n<p>An electron carries energy by its orbital and shell. That is, the more energy an electron has, the higher up it goes into its shell. I think this is because it has more kinetic energy, so it tends to move faster. Moving faster causes it to occupy a larger volume, and so for the nucleus to keep the electron, there must be more pull to keep it in place. I'm imagining it's like the orbit of a planet around the sun, where wider orbits signify more total energy in the system. The orbitals are (I'm guessing, but fairly certain) caused by the discrete nature of energy -- photons are the most irreducible form of energy, so an electron can only jump between orbitals by discrete amounts.</p>\n\n<p>So, inside the battery, the electrons feel a potential difference between the different poles of the battery. This potential difference imparts energy into the electron, causing it to jump to a higher orbital. It then travels through the atoms in the wire until it reaches the resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the resistor, energy is taken out of the electron. The electron jumps to a smaller orbital, and in the process it releases a photon. This release of a photon means it has given off energy. The photon, having energy, is converted to work and waste.</p>\n\n<p>The electrons, now occupying a smaller orbital, exits the resistor with less energy.Because their energy is smaller, their voltage drops. And this, I think, is the reason why it is called a <strong>voltage drop</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This answer raises the question, though -- how does a voltmeter detect this voltage drop, if it occurs in the orbital shells of an atom? And the answer is interesting: it doesn't. At least, not directly.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can read, what voltmeters do is measure the deflection of a pointer against a spring. The pointer, in turn, is moved by the repulsive forces of the electrons on a pivoting wheel inside the voltmeter. And the repulsive forces is, of course, directly proportional to the amount of energy inside the electrons. Because we know the equations of energy, all this is calibrated. What the voltmeter actually measures is not the voltage itself, but rather the force that the voltage difference exerts on the pointer of the voltmeter.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say much more on how the voltmeter works. I'm frankly not so sure if that's true, but I know that the moving current with a certain voltage must work in some way like I just said.</p>\n\n<p>When the electron comes back home to the cathode (because we're thinking in terms of actual electrons moving, rather than the conventional electron holes moving), its voltage will not be zero, but rather will be equal to the energy per eletron in the cathode. Kirchoff's law tells us that at every load, the voltage difference decreases due to the voltage drop. Because the electrons still have energy inside the cathode, this doesn't mean the voltage is zero there (causing electrons to have no energy, which intuitively makes them have no momentum, which can't be true). It just means that the energy when the electron comes back is now the same as the energy at the cathode, so there is no more potential difference and the journey of the electron stops.</p>\n\n<p>If I've made any glaring errors here (and I'm bound to have, as most of this is me guessing and trying to make sense of what I know), please feel free to edit me. And if I mis-explained something, please point out where in a comment, so I and everybody else can see where it's wrong and why. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I realize I used voltage in two ways here: the difference in potential between two points, and the energy per unit charge. One definition requires two points to be defined, whereas one requires only one point.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can reconcile this by imagining that there is the same voltage everywhere. Each electron has exactly the same amount of energy. In such a case, there is no voltage difference. There is no potential difference, meaning there is no gradient which will cause the electrons to move.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess I'm saying, voltage can be a point quantity, whereas the potential difference, or voltage difference, requires two points to be defined. Certainly, this is consistent with the definitions of voltage (and as I remember in class, voltage by itself is a scalar, so it only requires itself to be defined, not another point; the gradient or difference is what requires another point).</p>",

Sam is ______\".</p>\n\n<p>I do want to make the distinction that this should not be strictly related to money.

I ask, \"What fraction are red?\" Hopefully someone says $frac{1}{2}$ and we can discuss the misconception.  In terms of how to relate $frac{1}{2}$ to the ratio 1:2 I do it after establishing the equivalence of ratio by scaling up both sides. I want to make green from blue and yellow in the ratio 1:2. I have 2 tins of blue how many yellow? Students often say that's easy just double the tins of yellow because you have doubled the blue. Now I ask them if I had 1000 blue or something like they say 500 but this time because they recognise there are $frac{1}{2}$ the number of blue. A subtle change but one that recognise the proportion of blue and yellow is the same for equivalent ratios. Hope this helps.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>While grinding metal, sparks are produced because of <strong>Friction</strong>. The rotating grinder cuts through the metal molecules, rubbing against them and producing heat. Some particles get loose in this process and burn because of this heat.</p>\n\n<p>From Wikipedia, \"<em>Steel is an alloy of iron, with carbon being the primary alloying element, up to 2.1% by weight. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements, their form in the steel either as solute elements, or a precipitated phases, retards the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and so weak, and so it controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Steel gets its strength because of the carbon impurities in its lattice. So obviously, Steel is much more stronger than Iron. Aluminium on the other hand is even softer and lighter than Iron, so there's even lesser friction and hence, lesser sparks. There is also the point about rusting and Aluminium does not rust. Though I am not sure if this is directly related to the production of sparks.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>So, by your definition, you want not just a Ghost, but an Apparition: a Ghost with visible, recognizable humanlike presence.</p>\n\n<p>The XBox story was my first thought, too.</p>\n\n<p>This could indeed be a virtual one, a recording of them as in the XBox story, or even an AI, a learning system that has acquired their skills and behaviors at least in the very specific domain in which it is designed to learn.</p>\n\n<p>In the XBox case, rather than merely driving like they drove on their last lap, a learning system could drive like the drove on average, displaying random of their driving quirks; or could drive as they did at their best <em>on each stage</em> of the race, thus driving better in sum than they ever did in life.</p>\n\n<p>A recorded video of someone, projected, would also work. If holograms are possible, then you have the Star Wars \"Help me, Obi Wan Kenobe, you are my only hope!\" - a ghost of a living person perhaps. Otherwise, you can project onto a wall, or more mysteriously, a stream of smoke, mist, cloud, or water. Could also be a computer-generated sprite texture-mapped with the person's face. Particularly with a low-fidelity projection onto a vague mist, the computer-generatedness would not be so apparent.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other ways to record a person's passing. Perhaps, as they walked from a clearing, they swiped at the thick leaves, and in doing so, either deliberately or accidentally hacked out a person-shaped hole, which, when the sun sets in the evening and shines through it, illuminates the spray from the waterfall. Doesn't even have to be a hole anyone's hacked out - but more likely if done as a deliberate thing. Since the sun moves slowly, you could have it so that only when the light from the sun lit a crystal at a certain angle, it refracted to become a projector - that way you could limit it only to a few minutes, or even a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>One effect I've seen that caused much consternation was headlights over a hill, which, because of the angle of the road, would shine in the back of a ruined house: the house would look lived in, for a moment, and then would fall dark again as the car moved on. Headlights on hilltops have also caused any number of UFO sightings. So, they make good brief-unexplained-lightings. If a picture is briefly lit by headlights passing outside, and the figure in it appears to because the shadows cast on the picture move, that could be a convincing \"ghost\" effect. Lightning could have a similar effect.</p>\n\n<p>Another good effect is a moon-halo. Here's a good trick. When the moon is close to full and dew lies upon the grass, look at your shadow: you will be surrounded by a halo. Tell your friend \"Wow, there's a halo around your shadow!\" (as if you see the halo around <em>his</em> shadow, and not your own) and the odds of him thinking there's something mystical about himself are quite high. When you stand above a mist-covered valley, and your shadow is cast onto the mists below, that has the same effect, writ large. So in this way, someone could be convinced into thinking they see, perhaps, their own ghost, or at least an outline, with a glow from their spirit?</p>\n\n<p>Double-exposure is possible, too: taking shots with a film exposed some years ago that you did not know had already been used to shoot someone else, would show them as ghosts in the shots. Similarly for a videotape with an erase/record head that did not fully wipe the previous data, perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>For more modern digital tech, it would take some kind of software bug - or a virus/malware/joke app that would impose another character into existing video.</p>\n\n<p>In realtime, augmented reality apps like google goggles or yelp's equivalent, let you point your phone at things and see signs for places nearby, etc... what is there was software on your phone that meant, when you pointed your phone camera at something, you say your dead friend superimposed in the shot, or perhaps just their face overlaid over nearby faces that the camera software identified?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><em>Wow, what a great range of answers! Thanks everyone who has answered so far and I hope to see many more! Here's my take, after a half-day of on-off thought (also set up a few servers in-between):</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uploading</a> never worked. It turned out that creating a new memory-association-chain in a human brain involved a holistic effort by the entire brain, and the complexity of the process defeated the best human minds for centuries on end. All it did manage to create was an abomination, a sad simile, incapable of true consciousness, of genuinely remembering new experiences, or of adapting to new environments. A failure. </p>\n\n<p>With time, a new practice evolved, of decorating the crypts, cemeteries and cities of the dead with these holographic and magnetic-force-field projections of those no longer living, based on such partial uploads. Some were only triggered by specific actions, such as placing flowers in a particular vase in the crypt, or rippling the water in a still, crystal-clear pool, while some only activated on the anniversary of their death. The varieties were endless.</p>\n\n<p>As this became more accepted, and the projections were no longer seen as abominations, the practice grew in scope. After the massive blast that took out the Andromeda Gateway and the surrounding great city of Carston, surviving friends and relatives recreated a distorted, slowly evolving projected replica of the entire city and its millions of inhabitants from records of the town and of the people, all on top of the overgrown ruins. As a monument.</p>\n\n<p>On the <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8453/massive-murderous-destruction-also-manportable\">fierce battlefields</a> of the future, people's life-recorders sometimes survived the blast that killed their owners, and, left on the desolate and temporarily radioactive wastelands, the life-recorders triggered and released a sad and confused ghost, forever retracing their last steps and random fragments of their life. Those with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPE</a> power-plates had a lifetime measured in tens of millennia. </p>\n\n<p>Slowly, as the gap between those embracing technology and those that didn't grew, the daring, the curious, the brave and the restless grew weary of Earth and embarked in <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9022/how-to-get-across-the-galaxy-moving-slower-than-light-in-a-single-lifetime\">great journeys across space</a>, leaving behinds an ever-more conservative, ever regressing Earth. The <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8866/where-to-anchor-my-space-elevator\">long elevators</a> were torn off their sockets and cast out into space. Things that were once known, were forgotten. The great underground oil, coal and mineral manufacturers trudged on for millenia, undoing the depleting work of many centuries and creating <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8716/sapience-pulsar-could-intelligence-come-in-waves\">new resources for a new dawn</a>. Eventually even these great machines froze in their tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>The ghosts, however, lived on amid the crypts and ruins of those majestic towns of an age long forgotten.</p>",

Make sure that you're not swinging backwards back during execution. Do not use momentum during exercise and try to keep your body as straight as possible.

Although the causal link between contaminated hands and infectious disease transmission is one of the best-documented phenomena in clinical science, several factors have recently prompted a reassessment of skin hygiene and its effective practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Vita Ultra</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Even with use of antiseptic preparations, which substantially reduce counts of hand flora, no reductions beyond an equilibrium level are attained. The numbers of organisms spread from the hands of nurses who washed frequently with an antimicrobial soap actually increased after a period of time; this increase is associated with declining skin health. In a recent survey, nurses with damaged hands were twice as likely to be colonized with S. hominis, S. aureus, gram-negative bacteria, enterococci, and Candida spp. and had a greater number of species colonizing the hands.</p>",

I don't know if i'm not giving the butter-sugar mixture enough time to cool down but after I in the egg and chocolate, the batter looks too runny and oily.\nFirst Method: Melt butter and sugar together in a pot until homogeneous, add beaten egg then chocolate. Put all of that together with the dry ingredients and bake.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I tried doing something a little bit different. I've been making caramels, so I kind of experimented with my sugar.\nNew Method: Melt sugar until it becomes a syrup, then add hot melted butter until it becomes homogeneous. Add the eggs, chocolate and put them together with the dry ingredients. This time, the batter looked really good. It was nice and thick.</p>\n\n<p>This time the brownies did not become oily. They were good and fudgy.</p>\n\n<p>My question..does anybody melt their sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients in? I know that for Italian meringue and buttercreams, it is a necessity to melt the sugar, but for brownies? I don't know. It worked for me.</p>",

The r and w are the usual read and write permissions.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I use on Ubuntu/Apache, but I believe that it's also possible to do the same with the user (SUID). Maybe someone else can chip in if I have the syntax wrong, but I believe something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /data/www\nsudo chmod -R ug+rws /data/www\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will set read/write for user and group only, and force files to have the www-data:www-data user:group.</p>\n\n<p>However, read up on SUID and GUID, as by doing this you're granting other users the permissions of www-data. The other caveat is that if your drive is mounted with the nosuid flag set, none of this will work.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetocrystalline_anisotropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnetocrystalline anisotropy</a> is all about spontaneous magnetization. Considere a (single domain) ferromagnetic material. Depending on its crystal structure, its spontaneous magnetization will tend to be aligned with a direction that minimize the interaction energy between magnetic dipoles carried by the atoms contained in one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">unit cell</a> of the lattice.</p>\n\n<p>That's why, depending on the geometry of the lattice system, you will have different types of magnetic anisotropy : uniaxial (one single easy axe), cubic (2 axes, one easy and one hard), tetragonal, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the most common anisotropy one can meet is the uniaxial one, that is particulary useful for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner%E2%80%93Wohlfarth_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stoner-Wohlfarth model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how about when an external magnetic field is applied? Well, there are two kind of energies in competition : the anisotropy energy which is minimum when the magnetization is along the direction of the easy axis, and the Zeeman energy which is the interaction energy between the magnetization and the external field. This situation is well described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model and consists basically in minimizing the energy of the ferromagnetic system :\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi)=K\\sin^2\\theta-\\mu_0M_sH\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)\n$$\nThe first term is the anisotropy energy ($\\theta$ being the angle between the easy axis and the magnetization, and $K$ the anisotropy strength), the second correspond to the Zeeman energy ($H$ is the norm of the applied magnetic field and $\\phi$ the angle that it forms with the easy axis).</p>\n\n<p>For convinience, let be $\\phi=\\pi$ fixed as an example. Then the energy $\\mathrm{E}$ has to be minimize according to the variable $\\theta$. In dimensionless units, one have :\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{K}\\,\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi=\\pi)=\\sin^2\\theta+2h\\cos\\theta\\quad\\text{with}\\quad h=\\frac{\\mu_0M_sH}{2K}\n$$\nOne can easily find the equilibrium states $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ by computing $\\partial_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})=0$ :\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\equiv\\{0,\\pi,\\theta_h=\\arccos(h)\\}\n$$\nand then study their stability by looking at the sign of the quantity $\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})$, namely :\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=0)=2(1-h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\pi)=2(1+h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_h)=2(h^2-1)\n$$\nThe take home message here is that it is possible to change the stability of the different equilibrium solutions by varying the magnitude $H$ of the magnetic field, i.e. by varying $h$. By changing $h$, one can actually <strong>flip</strong> the magnetization from one equilibrium orientation to another.</p>",

It finds a few updates, downloads them (instantly, since it's the WSUS server), and installs them (pretty much instantly, which is very weird). Says everything was successful. When it checks for updates right after, it finds the SAME updates and you can go through this process an infinite amount of time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are no error codes generated.</li>\n<li>Those updates do not show up under \"Installed updates\" for removal.</li>\n<li>They do show up under the \"Update History\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've tried the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stop services, rename \"SoftwareDistribution,\" start services</li>\n<li>Stop services, move stuff out of \"Catroot2,\" start services</li>\n<li>Stop services, remove \"Catroot2,\" start services</li>\n<li>Combinations of the above all at once</li>\n<li>Try directly from Microsoft Update instead of WSUS</li>\n<li>Try with another administrative account</li>\n<li>Update Readiness tool - CheckSUR (no errors)</li>\n<li>FixIt for resetting Windows Update</li>\n<li>Check permissions on SoftwareDistribution, Catroot2, Registry entries</li>\n<li>Install updates manually - acts like it installs successfully, but it doesn't</li>\n<li>Uninstall the whole WSUS package, delete stores/DB, reinstall, reconfigure (they only have a handful of users/PCs which are mostly up-to-date)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, before I waste any more time, can I get the opinion of the collective minds of /r/sysadmin before I go crazy?</p>\n\n<p>For the record, the 4 updates that are showing right now are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>IE 11</li>\n<li>KB2871997</li>\n<li>KB2872339</li>\n<li>KB2882822</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also strange, there should be a LOT more updates showing.

Do the asylum scenes take place <em>before or after</em> the restaurant scene?</p>\n\n<p>There is no correct answer to this. Perhaps he was in the asylum and reflected on the events, as the movie showed, during his time there and found some glimmer of hope and waited in the restaurant. Or perhaps he waited in the restaurant, became more and more broken and ended up in the asylum.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, it's up to the viewer.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Ok, I have a strange issue. Besides appearing randomly, I finally experienced that also when I manually edit my server (VPS) (i.e. adding a domain) it modifies the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file. Only this time it needed a server reboot to have the issue though.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that modification my server directly replies with 'server not found' for every domain installed on the server, including those of clients. I need to manually remove the code it adds to that file- reboot the server and then everything is working properly again. I, of course, want to find the thing causing this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely, the edit to the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file has nothing to do with the changes made. It changes the vhost configuration for two domains; <code>iscs.nl</code> and <code>verboonhoveniers.nl</code>.

		"Body" : "<p>Going in a slightly different direction: don't go overboard. Most small-time prisons probably have a few minor defenses against spellcasters. They'll have their stuff taken, they'll be behind iron bars, if the jailor expects them to be spellcasters he\u00B4ll wear earplugs and hang the key on a 20 pound weight so it can't be Mage Handed and it\u00B4ll probably be dark, which makes vision targeting hard. Other than that; maybe a double set of doors with different keys, so that a single charm won't help, and a number of guards with orders to kill anyone who tries anything funny.</p>\n\n<p>If you go above and beyond this kind of thing for a general kind of prison, then you are basically unfairly targeting wizards. Most Wizards, especially the kind that you'd find in a low-level prison, will be contained by the above. If they try anything funny, they get stabbed to death by the guards. Most would probably not even <em>try</em> to escape. For every guard you charm, there's 5 more with pointy weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: many characters have a glib tongue and can talk their way out of a prison. We don't go around asking \"how do you keep a silver tongued rogue in prison?\". We don't ask \"How do you keep a barbarian who can bend the bars in prison?\", even though they probably can when in a Rage.</p>\n\n<p>If the wizard is high level and in a small-town prison <em>he will be able to escape.</em> So will any other high level character put in that situation; it's not a Wizard problem as much as it's a high level character vs low level challenge problem.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course when it comes to special anti-powerful-wizard-prisons, you can go all out, but those are fantastical locations, not simple buildings designed to hold not so powerful people.</p>",

You cock it and when you pull the trigger it blasts a small amount of salt at the fly.  However, if you don't have a fly swatter you might not have a fly gun either.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how you kill the fly, one thing that may help is to immediately close the door of whatever room you are in. Cutting down on where the fly can go will allow you to kill is more easily.  It is also helpful, if you can shoo in into another room, to pick a room that contains lighter colors.  It is very difficult to see a fly against a dark background.  With the door(s) closed and a clear view of the fly you may then be able to search around for something to hit it with, whether it is a shoe, a rolled up newspaper, or whatever.  If you are feeling adventurous, try killing it with your hands, either by clapping your hands as it flies between them, or batting it out of the air to stun it, and then finish it off before it recovers.</p>\n\n<p>If the fly is on something you don't want to damage (for instance, as vase or trinket), try picking up the object from behind and then moving it towards your hand.  I actually killed a fly like this recently.  The fly won't sense the movement of your hand as easily as your hand is not moving.</p>",

So for someone who knows their way around with ArcGIS, they could have noticed that I had just a folder in the code but I was calling <code>ListDataSets()</code> function which is wrong. Using <code>ListFeatureClasses()</code> solved the issue and the files were properly reprojected. Thanks for all the inputs.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Frankly, in the world that 5e has set up it would be difficult at best if you are not using the standard methods of restraining.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of an elite prison built for mages, guards that guard them would need earplugs to avoid any enchantment, and some form of hand/finger restriction would be necessary (manacled to their back with gauntlets that restrict any finger movement). Only the best trained guards in the village or trained animals should guard them (if druids, nix the animals). Trade guards out as frequently as possible to ensure no complacency. Most of the time a mage is unlikely to have Knock memorized, so it is unlikely to be used. Obviously those performing B&E are exceptions as would likely be an Arcane Trickster.</p>\n\n<p>They would, of course, need to be stripped of gear and given prison rags to wear.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, you have most of the ways listed above, but guard quality and restricting their actions when not actively working as slave labor (common among prisoners) would do the trick. </p>\n\n<p>Treat them <em>very</em> badly as well... The paranoid are going to ensure they never get a short rest (if warlocks are common), let alone a long rest. They should be performing demanding physical labor to keep them exhausted, sure. Slap them around a bit. It's a harsh world and those worried about spell casters that actually know about what they can do would take serious precautions.</p>\n\n<p>In FR, it would be easier to find a spellcaster to restrict the inmate than a magic item, so using spell casters to stop them would be helpful, but using a high level caster to stop an entire prison's worth of inmates would be a bit ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, Forest Gnomes are resistant to most of the spells that might cause a guard a direct problem, then they just have to be vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that when it comes down to it, they can't stop everything and eventually a caster is likely to find a way to escape if they had any memorized/known spells that might help at all and they are tenacious about it. It makes the game more dynamic and interesting when a dedicated criminal can get away with an escape.</p>\n\n<p>The last method is a very quick trial leading to execution for misuse of magic.</p>",

The last update was <code>Feeds last updated at 7:22</code> and it's now 1pm where I am at.</p>\n\n<p>when I first tested it from the command line, it said it needed me to change permissions of a few directories for it to work. I changed those and ran it again and it did not give me any errors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/usr/bin/php /var/www/mysite.ws/web/ttrss/update.php --feeds\n\n[18:59:18/38069] Processed 18 feeds in 24.8622 (sec), 1.3812 (sec/feed avg)\n[18:59:18/38069] Sending digests, batch of max 15 users, headline limit = 1000\n[18:59:18/38069] All done.\n[18:59:18/38069] cache/simplepie: removed 0 files.\n[18:59:18/38069] cache/images: removed 0 files.\n[18:59:18/38069] cache/export: removed 0 files.\n[18:59:18/38069] cache/upload: removed 0 files.\n[18:59:18/38069] Removed 0 old lock files.\n[18:59:18/38069] Removing old error log entries...\n[18:59:18/38069] Feedbrowser updated, 2 feeds processed.\n[18:59:18/38069] Purged 32 orphaned posts.\n[18:59:18/38069] Cleaned 0 cached tags.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And of course it worked and my feeds are updated which makes me think I'm doing something wrong on my cron setup.</p>\n\n<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_in_English#Ships\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gender in English</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Traditionally ships, even ships named after men such as USS <em>Barry</em>, countries, and oceans have been referred to using the feminine pronouns. The origins of this practice are not certain - it is not, as is sometimes postulated, a remnant of Old English's grammatical gender (in Old English, a ship, or \"scip\", was neuter, and a boat, or \"b\u0101t\", was masculine).<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>It is currently in decline (though still more common for ships, particularly in nautical usage, than for countries), and in Modern English, calling objects \"she\" is an optional figure of speech, while in American English it is advised against by <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have also heard vehicles other than ships personified and feminized, though this is as often as not done derisively \u2013 for when a man spends so much time working on or driving a treasured car that it is referred to as his girlfriend or wife, and so is a <em>she</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But in all cases, this is not <strong>grammatical</strong> gender, it is supposed to be the <strong>actual</strong> gender of the thing that you're referring to. \"Man\" isn't a \"masculine noun,\" it's a \"noun which refers to a male.\" Even in cases where <em>she</em> or <em>her</em> are applied to inanimate objects, that is because those are objects are being <strong>personified</strong> and <strong>feminized</strong>,  not because the nouns themselves are in any way feminine. When, say, \"liberty\" is referred to with <em>she</em>, the speaker is referring to some \"Lady Liberty,\" liberty incarnate in the form of a woman (and sometimes, Lady Liberty might <em>literally</em> be a woman in a work).</p>\n\n<p>Grammatically, <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> can be swapped at will, and it will not cause a sentence to become ungrammatical \u2013 just confusing because it will be difficult to be sure to whom the pronoun refers. English has no grammatical gender.</p>",

If you use /usr/bin/bash, presumably you'd like the mini-script to use it also. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>\"$@\"</code> is a shell idiom for \"interpolate all my arguments, quoting them if needed\". This peculiar syntax causes</p>\n\n<pre><code>script.sh 'my file' your\\ file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to interpolate the arguments as two elements</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my file\" \"your file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of the four that <code>$@</code> would yield</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my\" \"file\" \"your\" \"file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The last lines of the script arrange for a gnome-terminal to start running the mini-script and then starting an interactive shell. When the gnome-terminal exits, the temporary script is removed because littering is uncool.</p>\n\n<p>The last line is not a part of the mini-script, it demonstrates that the mini-script works. If the 11 line script above is in a file called <code>rt.sh</code> then the <code>chmod</code> makes it executable and then it is executed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ chmod +x rt.sh && ./rt.sh echo hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result of all of this will be a gnome terminal which starts up, displays</p>\n\n<pre><code>hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on its first line and then starts an interactive shell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>msw@myhost:~$\n</code></pre>",

I seriously think the focus on BOTH questions is wrong; You need to fix your user problem, not the server filesystem problem. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, given how crucial this filesystem is to the basic functionality of the machine, your best bet is to get out of thinking about this problem like a sys admin and start thinking about it like a manager. </p>\n\n<p>In other words: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Teach your users how to properly reboot this system to prevent the /var corruption problem to begin with. Documentation is your friend as they say. This is not an ideal solution for multiple reasons but at least it keeps them from frying filesystems. If nothing else, they shouldn't be touching the damn thing at all if it's your job to keep it running. </li>\n<li>Lock it away where they can't get to it. Seriously, if this is a server storing important data why is this not already the case? Is this a development system and the developers just don't know what they're doing or how damaging this can be ?? If so, again, teach them. It's not your job to fix stupid, it's your job to prevent stupid. </li>\n<li>Tell them to leave it the hell alone and come talk to you if there's problems. :)</li>\n<li>Lo-tech, but possibly helpful (though a fire hazard to be sure): Duct tape the shit out of both ends of the power cable so they have to spend 15 minutes trying to untape it. Hopefully, after five minutes and on layer 26 of tape they'll get frustrated and do what they're supposed to do: Talk to you to fix the actual problem that's motivating them to pull the plug in the first place. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is it about this machine that makes it so unstable they think it's necessary to reboot it ?? It's a debian system. They don't need \"reboots\", so what else is wrong with it ?? Are they worried about power consumption or are there services that are broken and unstable on it that only a reboot can solve ? If it's the latter, then your question is irrelevant and you have other work to do, sorry to say. </p>\n\n<p>If nothing else, you could approach your suggestion to be good to it and not reboot by pulling the cable as an exercise in energy conservation. Do you really want to get up from your desk to pull a power cable rather than just sit there, login, and reboot it on the command line ?? It takes like 2 seconds of work to do it that way, versus getting up, grumbling the entire time all the way to the device, yank the cable, plug it back in, wait for it to come back up broken, and then have to wait even longer for /var to be fscked. </p>\n\n<p>The get up-yank cable-wait for /var to fix it self cycle takes far longer, is far more complex to maintain in the long run, will cause all kinds of pain on your part, has already motivated you to ask the wrong questions, and will ultimately lead to you at the top of a bell tower with a love weapon and a death wish. </p>\n\n<p>Fix it right, by fixing your users or mitigate the damage by making it extremely challenging for them to accomplish stupid. I can't be more clear on the importance of this. </p>",

		"Title" : "Good question. \n\nIn the context of the first few chapters of Proverbs, t...",
		"Body" : "<p>Good question. </p>\n\n<p>In the context of the first few chapters of Proverbs, the compiler of the proverbs makes it very clear the book had its genesis in the throne room of Israel. Picture King David  carving out some quality time with one of his children, Solomon, for the express purpose of teaching his son some of the lessons he has learned over the years. David, you'll recall, was a \"man after God's own heart\" (Acts 13:22; 1 Sam 13:14), and he learned many things in his relationship with his God, some the hard way. </p>\n\n<p>David's purpose, then, was to instill in his son Solomon the godly principles which would guide and guard him throughout his life and his future reign as king of Israel. The pithy and memorably constructed proverbs of the day served to encapsulate important life-lessons in short, relatively easy-to-memorize stanzas. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, at about the same time as Solomon was composing, <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Ecclesiastes+12\" rel=\"nofollow\">pondering, searching out, and arranging many proverbs (perhaps 3000 or more</a>), Amenemope had already written his <em>The Wisdom of Amenemope</em>, a collection of teachings in proverb form on civil service, which may have predated Solomon's collection of proverbs. Some of Solomon's proverbs bear a striking resemblance to some of Amenemope's aphorisms (see the <em>NAS Bible, Updated Edition</em>, Introduction to Proverbs, under \"Author\"). These \"family resemblances\" suggest Solomon searched all the proverbs to which he had access in his day and \"cherry picked\" the ones which suited his purposes (and God's purposes, of course!)  </p>\n\n<p>Since an important theme of the entire book is sexual morality and the importance of young people (particularly the male of the species; i.e., guys) keeping their lives free from the polluting effects of unprincipled and unbridled sexual activity, Solomon chose a woman to personify wisdom to serve as a righteous counterpart to the \"immoral woman\" who appears and reappears throughout the book. She is alternately labeled \"the evil woman,\" \"an adventuress,\" the \"flattering foreigner,\" an \"adulteress,\" and perhaps many other titles, depending on which version of Proverbs you happen to read. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the <strong>evil woman</strong> serves as a foil** for the <strong>woman who is wisdom personified</strong>. Or, they act as foils for one another, as the contrast between the two serves to clarify the differences between them. One woman, for example, is out to bring a young man to ruin, whereas the other woman has only his best long-term interests at heart. One represents immediate gratification followed by regrettable consequences, and the other, delayed gratification followed by gifts that keep on giving. Contrast, for example, the adulteress who is mentioned throughout the book with another woman, this time <strong>the virtuous woman</strong>, who is described in detail in chapter 31!</p>\n\n<p>Was the personification of virtues a common feature of literature in Solomon's day? Frankly, I do not know. I will leave the answer to that question to another contributor who desires to research it. I will say, however, the Scripture does use \"stock characters\" who serve in pedagogical/analogical fashion to drive home some hortatory content (e.g., the \"story\" of two women--again!!--called Oholibah and Ohola, in Ezekiel 23). </p>\n\n<p>Female imagery is used in both positive and negative ways throughout the Scripture. Positively there are both the woman Wisdom who lifts up her voice in Proverbs 8 and the \"virtuous woman\" in Proverbs 31, and negatively there are both the Great Harlot (or \"Babylon the Great,\" of John's Revelation of Jesus Christ), and the </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"woman clothed with the sun, [with] the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars . . . who gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . . .\" (Rev 12:1,5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Great Harlot serves as a foil for the pregnant woman who gives birth to a son.</p>\n\n<p>Solomon's choice of a woman to serve as wisdom personified may have been his own invention, or perhaps he borrowed the concept from Amenemope or another writer either from or before his time. <em>That</em> he used a woman for his pedagogical purposes is certainly consistent with other such rhetorical tactics in Scripture, as I have already pointed out. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, you will notice I have connected the woman wisdom to other personifications which use women to communicate certain truths, and I have done so purposely, in part, to avoid eisegesis. While your question focuses on the Book of Proverbs, the Scripture comprises 66 books, and more than occasionally the imagery which is used in one book or context is also used in another book or context, giving the Scripture a marvelous unity amidst diversity. That fact, however, is one which is worthy of development, albeit at another time.  </p>\n\n<p>**For an interesting (and short) article on the use of foils, see this <a href=\"http://characterandcharacterization.webs.com/foil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">web page</a>.</p>",

You see, we always expect everything to be as we like it. We want to have control over all around us, even nature. In Christian theology, the earth is at the center of the universe. Our inherent conception is that we occupy a central, priveleged position in everything we do, from relationships to businesses to our understanding of the universe. The reality is that we are anything but priveleged. Science has repeatedly shattered this misconception of ours, but we still hang on to the ego. I suggest you watch Carl Sagan's famous speech <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZRF6zNoc\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Pale Blue Dot</em></a> which puts accross this message so powerfully. </p>\n\n<p>In such a case, I think it is extremely unfair to expect the speed of light have a value that appeals to us, other than $c$, the universal speed limit. In your case, the question is not about why the speed of light has that particular value, but why we think it is not supposed to be so.</p>",

I do sound design for video games. I <em>always</em> prefer non-edited files even if they require some extra work.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I find a very nice sound to fit my project but disappointed to see it was ruined because somebody assumed that it is better to add some fancy FX so that the sound would fit some genre in their mind (not mine) perfectly and everybody will love their SFX library. So I'm left with an \"if it was unedited it would be very useful sound\" with a strange reverb and 3 seconds of fade out on it.</p>\n\n<p>Let's check what the <em>Library Producer</em> <a href=\"http://sound.stackexchange.com/a/34272/12636\">says</a> about that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't have context. I'm giving you all of the clean sound that was in the air in that moment, and relying on you to use that sound as you see fit in your project. If I were to do a fade that I might like, you'd be cursing me for that the moment my fade didn't match your context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you do a lot of sound design work you get used to and small clean up requires just a little effort which definitely worths rather than searching for a similar sound although you already have the ruined version of a perfect fit.</p>\n\n<p>I think edited libraries are mostly fast-food libraries for people looking for some quick work that doesn't need or doesn't have budget for a sound design job.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>No, Jesus did not subject Himself to the law of the land by paying the temple tax. </p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the temple tax (see Exodus 30:12 ff.) was <em>not</em> a law of the land, but it was a law of Moses imposed on the \"sons of Israel\" both as a ransom for them and for the maintenance of the \"tent of meeting\" (i.e., the tabernacle).</p>\n\n<p>By paying the temple tax Jesus was avoiding unnecessary controversy and at the same time not offending the collectors of the tax, who were within their rights to do so (again, see Exodus 30:12 ff.). </p>\n\n<p>We do well, however, to follow Jesus' line of reasoning for doing so, and the logic he used with impetuous Peter who took it upon himself to speak for Jesus when asked if his teacher (i.e., Jesus) paid the two-drachma tax. <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Matthew+17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is what Constable says about this passage:</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Jesus turned this inquiry from the tax collector into a teaching situation for Peter and presumably the other disciples. Jesus changed the tax from a religious one to a civil one to make His point clearer. The principle is the same in both cases, but it was easier to illustrate in the civil arena of life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jesus\u2019 point was that [just] as the sons of kings are exempt from the taxes their fathers impose, . . . He [too] was exempt from the taxes His Father imposed. He meant the temple tax. The temple really belonged to God (Mal. 3:1). Jesus was teaching Peter the implications of His deity. <em>He was not teaching Peter to fulfill his civic responsibility</em> [my italics].</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Even though He was exempt, Jesus would pay the tax because He did not want to offend anyone needlessly (cf. 5:29). Failure to pay the tax would create unnecessary problems. Because Peter was one of Jesus\u2019 disciples and one of God\u2019s children through faith in Jesus, he also had no obligation to pay the temple tax (cf. 12:1-8) . . .. Since the sons of God are exempt from maintaining the temple and its service, the end of this system of worship appeared to be approaching, as it was. Here is another indication that Jesus ended the Mosaic Law (15:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus' paying of the temple tax for both himself and Peter was not an instance of Jesus subjecting himself to any law, whether imposed by the state or by God through Moses for Israel. Rather, paying the tax was a teaching opportunity through which he taught his disciples about his deity and specifically about his relationship to the Law and to the Law Giver. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is said that no one is above the law. No one, that is, except the Law Giver.  Some of Jesus' most memorable words began with the phrase, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You have heard that it was said, . . .. But I say unto you . . ..\" (see Matthew 5:21 ff.), </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and yet, the same Jesus also said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Do not think I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17 NASB Updated). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Christians thank God that though Jesus was above the Law, he also came to fulfill it perfectly for those of us who could not.  </p>",

		"Title" : "Design a system for real time events delivery",
		"Body" : "<p>Please share your thoughts over this designing question (If you need any more info, pls. do let me know): GIVEN: Let's say we have a popular eCommerce site with lots of sellers and millions of products. The system has a CatalogManager Service which is being called by various seller platforms to update info (attributes) about seller and it's products. For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.</p>\n\n<p>TO DESIGN: There are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'. Other example, SearchService must be notified that 'Hey, Seller S1 brand name has changed to New_Brand' so that it can change it's index to be searched.</p>\n\n<p>Design such a system which can scale & is fault tolerant ensuring all edge cases including one mentioned below:-</p>\n\n<p>Every back-end service may not be interested in all the events. It may only wish to listen subset of attributes. E.g. ShippingService may only want if product dimension related attributes change. So how will you ensure that only related messages reach to consumer services?</p>\n\n<p>How will you ensure that event message published by producer service (CatalogManager) reacheed to the related consumer service for sure and in REAL TIME?</p>\n\n<p>How can you ensure the messages passed to backend services are in sync (in order it's important)</p>\n\n<p>How to ensure that same event is not messaged twice to the consumers? Although, eventually it will result in same data state but still looking at scale of the events this would be a burden to backend system</p>\n\n<p>How would you design such a system?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>From what I understand, unless such as in the 3.5e example where the cantrip or spell specifially says the cantrip or spell can be executed in conjunction with an attack, that itself IS an attack or action.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if you read the 3.5e version of the cantrip you posted, it says you do a <strong>melee touch attack</strong> to do the fire damage, it does <strong>NOT</strong> mention doing the damage in addition to any bludgeoning damage from a martial arts unarmed attack for instance. So I think it's either/or and cannot be combined, you have to choose which one you are performing.</p>\n\n<p>In 5e, an unarmed attack is undescribed (except perhaps by the player flourishing his action with story telling). The monk could be hitting with a open hand, fist, elbow, knee, head, kick, or <strong>EVEN</strong> with weapons that qualify as monk's weapons (simple weapons). You'd be hard pressed to explain how the flame traveled from the palm of your hand along the shaft of the staff.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, mages can use staffs, rods and wands in touch attacks can't they? I don't have a ready reference to check that for 5e. There is a discussion here <a href=\"http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/46704/can-the-arcane-druidic-focus-staff-double-as-quarterstaff\">Can the Arcane Staff Double as a Quarter Staff</a> about this particular question. It's a bit more broad than your specific question, but may just be part the answer you are looking for by answering whether a staff can double as a quarter staff and THUS be treated for touch when part of an unarmed attack sequence. I don't think it will grant additional damage, but it COULD allow your cantrip to cause 1-6 fire damage rather than 1d4 bludgeoning. I think that would still have questionable effect though since the amount of damage is rather comparable once all bonuses are taken into account, the principle difference being between bludgeoning vs fire damage. I also still don't have my PHB with me, but monks get a elemental discipline called something like <strong>Fangs of the Fire Snake</strong> or something like that that grants 10 ft reach and 1d10 fire damage <strong>in addition to</strong> your bludgeoning damage.</p>\n\n<p>I'll update that monk discipline later when I get home.\nEDIT: Updated Discipline</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Thanks to @Jerryno, I have an even more general solution than I was hoping.  In fact, it addresses any degree of symmetry that I need.  Here are the details.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my base geometry with only a subsurf modifier:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Qz2ta.png\" alt=\"Base geometry and circle\"></p>\n\n<p>Notice it also shows a Bezier circle that I will be using.</p>\n\n<p>1 - Add an Array modifier with a fixed count of 3.  Notice that Merge is checked.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6hp6Y.png\" alt=\"Array modifier\"></p>\n\n<p>This gives a result like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZaD1f.png\" alt=\"Array modifier result\"></p>\n\n<p>2 - Next we want to use a Curve modifier to bend things around the circle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/waEkn.png\" alt=\"Curve Modifier\"></p>\n\n<p>This gives something like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/EDRGY.png\" alt=\"Curve modifier result\"></p>\n\n<p>3 - Don't fret about the gap.  In order to close the gap, select the Bezier Circle and type \"3/pi\" in the X Scale and Y Scale.  Since Blender interprets the Python expression it will show .955 in the cells as in:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PRCps.png\" alt=\"Scaling down the circle\"></p>\n\n<p>Which gives the very satisfying result of:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gZsPC.png\" alt=\"Trilateral symmetry achieved!\"></p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, if you change the Array modifier fixed count to anything, N, and change the scale on the circle to N/pi, you can get higher degrees of symmetry (e.g. w/ N = 5):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/HXgOA.png\" alt=\"Quintlateral symmetry\"></p>\n\n<p>How cool is that?!  (Man, I love Blender!)</p>\n\n<p>One more thing might make this even more convenient.  Since we have an odd number (3 in my case) of repeats, it isn't truly symmetrical.  When I edit, it looks like...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mWLO0.png\" alt=\"Editing\"></p>\n\n<p>If you want this edit to be truly symmetrical (i.e. each edit affects 6 analogous areas in the final geometry), then put a Mirror modifier for the X axis first in the modifier stack and only start with half of the original geometry.  And we get...</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/f4TEd.png\" alt=\"Full symmetry\"></p>\n\n<p>So to summarize, the full recipe of modifiers for this N-lateral symmetry is:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Mirror Modifier in X</p>\n\n<p>2 - Array Modifier w/ a fixed count of N</p>\n\n<p>3 - Curve modifier with a Bezier Circle</p>\n\n<p>4 - Make sure the Bezier circle has a radius of N/pi</p>",

It is generally fixable through conscious attention.</p>\n\n<p>I work developing musical training computer games for children.</p>\n\n<p>My mother sang to me as a child, and she is tone-deaf. I also learned to sing in a tone deaf manner. We learn by copying.</p>\n\n<p>I subsequently spent thousands of hours playing the piano, but my early training (basically to NOT pay attention to the sounds I am making) retarded my musical development. That caused me much suffering.</p>\n\n<p>It was only in my 30s that I trained myself consciously to sing correctly, it has been hard work. I taught myself to sing accurately using a solfege system.</p>\n\n<p>I fixed such things as gradual pitch drift, incorrect intervals such as getting a fourth, fifth, octave muddled up, squashed thirds.</p>\n\n<p>It is a blessing for your child that you are conscious enough to enquire.</p>\n\n<p>You should find your child a teacher, who can teach them to sing. This should be the first instrument everyone learns upon, it is our natural inbuilt instrument. To try and bypass it is stupid. Chopin said <strong><em>\"If you wish to play, you must first learn to sing.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If your child has a teacher, you don't need to worry about damaging their musicality.</p>\n\n<p>If the child doesn't, you do. Even by abstaining from singing, your child will learn to perceive the world as you do by a million subtle cues. The way you use words, the way your eyes will move, the way your physical form follows conscious intent. And the set of conditions that led to your own disconnection may well be transferred to the child. Maybe you are primarily a visual person, this is your primary perception and the root of your attention. It's quite easy to see if someone is primarily a visual person. The renowned 19th century music teacher Evelyn Fletcher Copp (the first teacher to systematically impart Absolute Pitch to her child students) said that when a parent brought a prospective new student to see her, she would look closely and ascertain how the child perceives the world (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, logical, emotional, etc).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth remembering that these balances can be adjusted. Imbalance can show proclivity which is to be encouraged. But at the same time weaknesses should be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is strongly primarily visual, maybe practising music in a pitch dark room would encourage them to rebalance.</p>",

But for us programmer types who have to do sysadmin stuff out of necessity here's what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>Short answer: My MAC address was incorrect in my /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192 configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Long explanation: VMware generates a new mac address for each new virtual nic when you provision a new VM from a template. Seems reasonable. But when you look at the hardware address configured in the VMWare setting it only shows you the first four octet in a disabled text box that will not allow you to see the rest. My mac address in the configuration seemed to have the same first four octets so I assumed incorrectly that the mac address in the config was correct. After shutting down the VM, I could scroll to the right and see the rest of the mac address. Upon noticing it was different, I changed it in my config and everything worked.</p>\n\n<p>If Redhat devs read this site, please put some meaningful error messages when things like this go wrong. Thanks!</p>",

However, under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Backup > Operational, I'm seeing an event with the ID of 5 and a description like this: Backup started at '10/4/2011 12:30:12 PM' failed with following error code '2147942512'.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most informative posts I've found on this error is located on Microsoft's Technet Forums <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsbackup/thread/c55e4e16-22af-4d84-b2c4-7aedcf512469\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In that post, a Microsoft representative gives this hazy explanation:</p>\n\n<p><em>auto-delete feature to ensure that at least some old backup copies are maintained on the disk -- does not automatically delete backups if space utilization by older copies is less than 1/8 of the disk size or in other words, 13% of the disk size. that means if the one full backup copy does not fit in the 7/8 of the disk size, backup may fail with disk full error. auto-delete will not automatically delete older versions to reclaim more older versions of backup.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the above explanation, I do not understand what is meant by \"older copies\" except that it appears that anything older than the very last shadow copy would be considered \"older copies\". I'm going to make the assumption that this problem where auto-delete will not work will affect any hard drive that is large enough to make an effective backup drive, or in other words, any hard drive that is large enough to hold more than one backup/shadow copy at once.</p>\n\n<p>The same MS representative proposes the solution of using a larger backup drive. I can't understand how this will help. It appears to me it will simply delay the problem until a later date.</p>\n\n<p>In order to resolve this problem for now, I did the following: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Assign the backup drive a disk letter under disk management. </li>\n<li>Run the command line with Administrative rights.</li>\n<li><em><strong>diskshadow.exe</strong></em> [enter]</li>\n<li><em><strong>delete shadows oldest x:</strong></em> [enter] (where X: is the letter you\nassigned your backup drive)</li>\n<li>I manually ran the above command some 60 or 80 times to free up about 200 GB of space on my 1 Terrabyte External Hard drive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, I do not feel this is a satisfactory solution to prevent the problem from happening again in the future. <strong>Does anyone have a solution to prevent your Windows Server backup drive from getting full?</strong></p>",

Now consider a homomorphism $f:G\\to G/H$, where $f(x)=xH$. The kernel is $\\{x\\in G: f(x)=eH=H\\}$.\nI have to show that this set is equivalent to $H$. Since $H$ is a group then $xH$ for $x\\in H$ is a subset of $H$. If $x\\in G$ but $x\\notin H$ then $xh\\notin H$ just because $xe\\notin H$. So $H=\\{x\\in G: f(x)=eH=H\\}$ which means that $H$ is a kernel or normal subgroup of $G$.</p>\n\n<p>Is there something wrong?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>While the two are related,  the amount of time you spend doing workouts for your muscles is not necessarily the way to build bigger muscles. Though you clearly need to work out if you expect your muscles to grow larger, if the size of your muscles was solely based on the time you spent using them, then marathon runners, cashiers and bus boys would easily have the largest muscles. Muscle growth is about repetition with resistance and nutrition. The first stage the workout is what provides your muscles with their initial size. As you perform repetitions with heavy weights, your muscles start to expand because new muscle cells are making your tissues expand. However, once your workout is over, those new muscle cells start to slowly die because your body has used up its nutrition. This causes that same muscle growth to start to contract. That is why the sooner you can heal those cells by eating foods high in amino acids  the more of the cells you can save before they die, because amino acids are the key ingredient towards healing dying cells.strongmenmuscle is-no2-maximus-scam-or-fake/</p>",

Passing 'full' in the\n; query string will also return status for each pool process.\n; Example:\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json&full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html&full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml&full\n; The Full status returns for each process:\n;   pid                  - the PID of the process;\n;   state                - the state of the process (Idle, Running, ...);\n;   start time           - the date and time the process has started;\n;   start since          - the number of seconds since the process has started;\n;   requests             - the number of requests the process has served;\n;   request duration     - the duration in \u00B5s of the requests;\n;   request method       - the request method (GET, POST, ...);\n;   request URI          - the request URI with the query string;\n;   content length       - the content length of the request (only with POST);\n;   user                 - the user (PHP_AUTH_USER) (or '-' if not set);\n;   script               - the main script called (or '-' if not set);\n;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because memory calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n; If the process is in Idle state, then informations are related to the\n; last request the process has served. Otherwise informations are related to\n; the current request being served.\n; Example output:\n;   ************************\n;   pid:                  31330\n;   state:                Running\n;   start time:           01/Jul/2011:17:53:49 +0200\n;   start since:          63087\n;   requests:             12808\n;   request duration:     1250261\n;   request method:       GET\n;   request URI:          /test_mem.php?N=10000\n;   content length:       0\n;   user:                 -\n;   script:               /home/fat/web/docs/php/test_mem.php\n;   last request cpu:     0.00\n;   last request memory:  0\n;\n; Note: There is a real-time FPM status monitoring sample web page available\n;       It's available in: ${prefix}/share/fpm/status.html\n;\n; Note: The value must start with a leading slash (/).

If this value is not set, no\n; URI will be recognized as a ping page. This could be used to test from outside\n; that FPM is alive and responding, or to\n; - create a graph of FPM availability (rrd or such);\n; - remove a server from a group if it is not responding (load balancing);\n; - trigger alerts for the operating team (24/7).\n; Note: The value must start with a leading slash (/). The value can be\n;       anything, but it may not be a good idea to use the .php extension or it\n;       may conflict with a real PHP file.\n; Default Value: not set\n;ping.path = /ping\n\n; This directive may be used to customize the response of a ping request. The\n; response is formatted as text/plain with a 200 response code.\n; Default Value: pong\n;ping.response = pong\n\n; The access log file\n; Default: not set\n;access.log = log/$pool.access.log\n\n; The access log format.\n; The following syntax is allowed\n;  %%: the '%' character\n;  %C: %CPU used by the request\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{user}C for user CPU only\n;      - %{system}C for system CPU only\n;      - %{total}C  for user + system CPU (default)\n;  %d: time taken to serve the request\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{seconds}d (default)\n;      - %{miliseconds}d\n;      - %{mili}d\n;      - %{microseconds}d\n;      - %{micro}d\n;  %e: an environment variable (same as $_ENV or $_SERVER)\n;      it must be associated with embraces to specify the name of the env\n;      variable.

A value of '0s' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_slowlog_timeout = 0\n\n; The timeout for serving a single request after which the worker process will\n; be killed. This option should be used when the 'max_execution_time' ini option\n; does not stop script execution for some reason. A value of '0' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_terminate_timeout = 0\n\n; Set open file descriptor rlimit.\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_files = 1024\n\n; Set max core size rlimit.\n; Possible Values: 'unlimited' or an integer greater or equal to 0\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_core = 0\n\n; Chroot to this directory at the start. This value must be defined as an\n; absolute path. When this value is not set, chroot is not used.\n; Note: you can prefix with '$prefix' to chroot to the pool prefix or one\n; of its subdirectories. If the pool prefix is not set, the global prefix\n; will be used instead.\n; Note: chrooting is a great security feature and should be used whenever\n;       possible. However, all PHP paths will be relative to the chroot\n;       (error_log, sessions.save_path, ...).\n; Default Value: not set\n;chroot =\n\n; Chdir to this directory at the start.\n; Note: relative path can be used.\n; Default Value: current directory or / when chroot\nchdir = /\n\n; Redirect worker stdout and stderr into main error log. If not set, stdout and\n; stderr will be redirected to /dev/null according to FastCGI specs.\n; Note: on highloaded environement, this can cause some delay in the page\n; process time (several ms).\n; Default Value: no\n;catch_workers_output = yes\n\n; Limits the extensions of the main script FPM will allow to parse. This can\n; prevent configuration mistakes on the web server side. You should only limit\n; FPM to .php extensions to prevent malicious users to use other extensions to\n; exectute php code.\n; Note: set an empty value to allow all extensions.\n; Default Value: .php\n;security.limit_extensions = .php .php3 .php4 .php5\n\n; Pass environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

These settings\n; overwrite the values previously defined in the php.ini. The directives are the\n; same as the PHP SAPI:\n;   php_value/php_flag             - you can set classic ini defines which can\n;                                    be overwritten from PHP call 'ini_set'.\n;   php_admin_value/php_admin_flag - these directives won't be overwritten by\n;                                     PHP call 'ini_set'\n; For php_*flag, valid values are on, off, 1, 0, true, false, yes or no.\n\n; Defining 'extension' will load the corresponding shared extension from\n; extension_dir. Defining 'disable_functions' or 'disable_classes' will not\n; overwrite previously defined php.ini values, but will append the new value\n; instead.\n\n; Note: path INI options can be relative and will be expanded with the prefix\n; (pool, global or /usr)\n\n; Default Value: nothing is defined by default except the values in php.ini and\n;                specified at startup with the -d argument\n;php_admin_value[sendmail_path] = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i -f www@my.domain.com\n;php_flag[display_errors] = off\n;php_admin_value[error_log] = /var/log/fpm-php.www.log\n;php_admin_flag[log_errors] = on\n;php_admin_value[memory_limit] = 32M\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and i've added this file to /etc/nginx/conf.d/</p>\n\n<pre><code>server {\n    listen       80;\n    listen       443 ssl;\n    server_name  ~^(?<site>[^.]+)\\.(?<project>[^.]+)\\.(?<user>[^.]+)\\.(development|dev).(?<domain>[^.]+)\\.(?<tld>[^.]+)$\n    server_name  ~^(?<project>[^.]+)\\.(?<user>[^.]+)\\.(development|dev).(?<domain>[^.]+)\\.(?<tld>[^.]+)$;\n\n    charset utf-8;\n\n    root   /home/${user}/projects/${project};\n    index  index.html index.htm index.php app_dev.php;\n\n     set $symfony false;\n    if ( -d /home/${user}/projects/${project}/web) {\n        set $symfony true;\n    }\n\n    if ($symfony = true) {\n        rewrite ^/app_dev\\.php/?(.*)$ /$1 permanent;\n    }\n\n     location / {\n        try_files $uri /web/$uri @rewriteapp;\n    }\n\n    location @rewriteapp {\n        if ($symfony = true) {\n            rewrite ^/static/(.*)$ /web/static/$1 last;\n            rewrite ^(.*)$ /app_dev.php/$1 last;\n        }\n\n        rewrite ^(.*)$ /index.php last;\n        break;\n    }\n\n     location ~ ^/(app|app_dev|config)\\.php(/|$) {\n        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;\n        if ($user = \"joeri\") {\n            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9002;\n        }\n\n        fastcgi_index  index.php;\n        fastcgi_param  org             $site;\n        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/web/$fastcgi_script_name;\n        include        fastcgi_params;\n    }\n\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\n        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;\n        if ($user = \"joeri\") {\n            fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9002;\n        }\n\n        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$;\n        fastcgi_index  index.php;\n        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;\n        include        fastcgi_params;\n    }\n\n    # deny access to .htaccess files, if Apache's document root\n    # concurs with nginx's one\n    #\n    location ~ /\\.ht {\n        deny  all;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when i try to restart php-fpm i get this error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ERROR: unable to bind listening socket for address '127.0.0.1:9003':\n  Permission denied (13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It clearly is something with permissions but i have no idea what permissions to change.

		"Body" : "<p>I'm going from the UK to Merate, Italy next month. I'll be flying into MXP and really don't fancy driving, so I booked an advance train ticket to get me from Malpensa Aeroporto to Cernusco-Merate. So far, so good! EDIT: I'm taking the Malpensa Express into Milano and then a Regionale train out to Merate. I booked through Italiarail.com.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I received the information on how to pick up my tickets, it included a note which seems to imply that all the self-service ticket pickup kiosks in Italy are out of order and that I have to visit a larger Trenitalia station before I travel, where an assistant will print out the ticket for me. Because I won't be in Italy at all before I want to travel, I may have an interesting time trying to get my tickets. For information, <a href=\"http://www.italiarail.com/ticket-pickup-instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">a page of ticket pickup advice from the train booking website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone here experienced this Italian train ticket pickup problem first hand? Can someone who has first-hand experience explain to me what is going on with the kiosks, how long you'd expect to wait, and why there's no warning before you book that you can't easily collect these tickets?</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to know exactly what the situation is so that I can alter my plans accordingly. If it becomes too much hassle, I will probably just attempt to get a refund and buy a ticket on the day.</p>",

I added an <code>index.js</code> that works as the facade / wrapper for <code>picker.js</code>, <code>pick.date</code> and <code>pick.time</code>, allowing them to be used out of the box with Browserify by issuing the typical <code>require('pickadate')</code>. It doesn't need to be assigned to a variable since pickadate attaches itself directly to the jQuery object. You can check <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mogarick/edfe96cb0a7682996c1d\" rel=\"nofollow\">this gist with the <code>index.js</code> code I used</a></p>\n\n<p>This change is a copy of the way the CryptoJS library by @evanvosberg exposes its different algorithms through the same pattern implemented in its <code>index.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>The only additional change would be to modify the property <code>main</code> in pickadate <code>package.json</code> to point to <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've just send a message to @amsul, the <a href=\"https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">pickadate</a> author asking for the possibility of integrate this changes directly into the pickadate github repo.</p>\n\n<p>I hope people trying to use pickadate with browserify can find this solution and stop getting frustrated trying to make them play well together!</p>\n\n<p>Greetings to everybody!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>For context, I am a forty-something male from the Great Lakes region of the United States.  I work full-time as something other than a writer.</p>\n\n<p>About 25 years ago in high school, I was an almost-straight-A student.  The \"almost\" was always due to English class.  I hated, nay despised, the writing assignments I was given, believing the forced topics to be inane and worthless.  Whenever I had to write an essay or research paper in another class, I could do just fine, thank you.  I didn't need to compare and contrast the points of view of the boy in the story we had read with that of his father, as an example.  Who cares?</p>\n\n<p>My reason for mentioning this is that any previous answers I've heard to questions like this were along the lines of \"your teachers at school\" and \"your supervisor/ co-workers.\"  But I am long out of school and failed to recognize the resources at the time, and my workplace involves no creative writing whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>So now, I find myself with a couple of neat stories inside my head begging to be let out.  I have also been diverting increasing amounts of my \"hobby time\" to sitting at this computer and typing out bits and pieces of these stories.  When I review my own work, I know when I've written something bad, and can redo it.  But I'm less confident in when I've written something really good, like maybe-I-could-publish-it-good.</p>\n\n<p>I've got some characters, scenes, and dialogues I think are ok.  But I also have some weak transitions, plot holes, and other minor issues I just can't seem to be able to tweak.</p>\n\n<p>Where can I go, or who can I speak with, to read bits of my work, give me some friendly advice and constructive criticism?</p>",

Turns out I was using an N channel MOSFET wrong, and it's not good as a high side switch like this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideas to fix:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I could move the MOSFET to GND</strong> of the LED array with a 100 ohm resistor on the gate. I believe this would allow it to act like a switch in the manner that I really want. However, the addressable LEDs still draw a decent amount of power when their GND is disconnected! It seems the return path goes down the CLK and DAT lines. This is not a problem when VCC is disconnected. This means I would need three MOSFETS, one for each of CLK, DAT and GND, driven by one pin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I could use a P-Channel on the high side</strong>, but to turn it off I need to supply voltage. When turned off, I want to be conserving power with the micro controller in a super low power mode . In that state wasting current holding the MOSFET closed seems wasteful, and I'm not the micro controller could do that in sleep mode.</p>\n\n<p>Both those options seem kind of inelegant. What I seem to need is a simple 4 pin component (VCC, GND, GATE, OUTPUT) that can connect VCC and OUTPUT when I pull GATE high. Does such a thing exist?</p>\n\n<p>What do you think is my best bet for making this work with the fewest/simplest components?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>OK Mo'ne Davis is a horrible example.  Chances are she doesn't grow at all and her fastball hits 75 mph max.  Many 13 year old girls are fully grown, height-wise.  I have personally been around 2 very athletic girls that were very similar to her - one as an umpire and another I personally coached.  The girls at 13 are just more mature than boys of that age psychologically and developmentally.  Boys hit their growing spurt around 14-15.  So girls have two years in school that they might be faster or more talented in the strength/speed sports.  [Actually 4 years ago one of my boys played against a 12 year old girl in football that was laying kids out.  She is talented and will probably have multiple big-time college offers for 2-3 sports but you would laugh if she had football pads on now.  She's 5-8 120 pounds... almost the same size as when she played football]</p>\n\n<p>I want a disclaimer to my answer in that I am pretty strict what I consider a sport.  Auto racing, board games, and strategy games are not sports to me.  I personally feel that bowling is not a sport (but a great game) and golf is right on the lowest fringe of sport.</p>\n\n<p>Do women have a chance?  Well not anytime soon.  They just don't have the physical attributes that will help them, unless they start altering their physical attributes.  I remember my college (large D1 school) having the WNBA players stay in the dorms over the summer.  I was on the basketball practice team.  Was probably at the level of a DIII starter but nothing great.  We would play the WNBA girls daily.  My team would include 1-2 guys from practice squade and 2-3 \"good\" pickup players. </p>\n\n<p>In their three weeks there the WNBA players never won a game.  They scratched, clawed, brought out their 6-7 big, it didn't matter.  They couldn't stop our first step or the power drive.   Number don't lie.  We won probably close to 100 games.  Most of these girls were stars at big D1 programs.  We didn't hold back at all (mainly because they started playing dirty in game one) but we weren't also \"great\" players.  I believe all of the girls we played were better basketball players than us - fundamentals, shooting, tactic, positioning, whatever - but the athletic disadvantage was too much to make up.</p>\n\n<p>What sport are women closest to catching men?  I would think it would be the marathon.  Running that distance requires using your body's existing fat reserves.  Women have an advantage here.  They can possibly be lean and in race shape with more fat in their body.  </p>",

But on second thought, this does not make any sense in this scenario - I only have a training collection but I dont have access to index the indexed IR data. Would it be reasonable to only use the IDF value for such estimation (is IDF enough to establish weight of a term in general)?

They chose to define it as a player who establishes control of the ball, lands on the field, and then holds it for long enough to do something else. This something else is commonly referred to as a football move. </p>\n\n<p>This seems like a reasonable enough line to draw because if a player has the time and wherewithal to do something else, he's probably done catching the ball. If he doesn't, he's probably still in the process of catching the ball.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nEzra</p>",

It's a fun 'puzzle' and since you decide where to hide the rewards, the difficulty level is adjustable. As my dog has gotten better at finding the hidden treats I've had to come up with more advanced places to hide them (inside old shoe boxes, underneath her dog bed...etc.) If you try this technique and your dog is already a bit destructive you might want to be extra mindful of where you hide the treats (so you're not encouraging your dog to destroy or mess up anything else)</p>\n\n<p>For a more high tech solution there are weird robot toys that play with your dog while you're away...something like this:  <a href=\"http://goifetch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goifetch.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to add that one of the best ways to make your dog less restless while your away is to tire your dog out while you are around.

The Multi-server feature seems to be very limited, but it could be so much better with a little effort.  I figure it will be removed from the product one of these years, fixed, and then added back as a great \"new\" feature in the ENT edition.  </p>\n\n<p>I think the limitation is in the extended procs such as xp_msx_enlist code.  They determine the name of the local instance.  If it was T-SQL code, it might have been easier to fix.  As far as I can tell, the only place the target name is stored is in msdb.dbo.systargetservers table on the master server.  If the targets could be tricked into requesting a sync for the FSDN, then the table could have be updated (hacked) directly to use the FQDN.  </p>\n\n<p>If it was open source, it would have been fixed years ago.

(Thanks Top Gun)</p>\n\n<p>I think that would work for you, but if I have misinterpreted your need post again with more info.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>",

The only thing that I have found to work is this setup.</p>\n\n<p>All my downloads of new episodes, etc. are done on the MacBook Pro. I basically leave iTunes running most of the time even when I am away and only have my portable devices with me.</p>\n\n<p>I use Playlists on the MacBook pro iTunes to sort episodes for which device. Video podcasts primarily go to the iPad and audio primarily to the phone, but when flying I often put audio podcasts on the iPad to save battery life on the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Then in iTunes I connect each device and use the settings for the device to control which podcasts and which playlists are synced to the device. I generally only sync checked files and I uncheck episodes after they are played.</p>\n\n<p>Also in iTunes on the MacBook Pro I have smart playlists for recently played and recently added and I use those to help me find the newer Podcast episodes quickly and to uncheck played episodes quickly.</p>\n\n<p>This is admittedly a lot of work. I spend a couple hours or more each week managing my playlists. I sync nearly every day to add new episodes and clean up old episodes. I just could never make the \"automatic\" sync'ing work the way I wanted, so I decided to take control of it with these techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Final Note: in iTunes Preferences on the Store tab, I turn off Sync Podcast subscriptions and settings. I have found there is a bug in this process that sometimes causes iTunes to stop downloading any podcasts. There was some discussion on the Apple Support Forums that pointed me to this change.</p>",

They used to mean that you owned a stock or had sold a stock short.  Now they are often used to say you make money when a value goes up (long) or make money when some value goes down (short).</p>\n\n<p>In this case whenever you own a call or a put you are \"long\" volatility.  Meaning that as volatility increases the value of your position increases (holding everything else the same).  How much added value that you get for an certain increase in volatility (called vega) <a href=\"http://totaloptions.com.au/818/introduction-to-options-trading-option-vega/\" rel=\"nofollow\">depends on how in/out of the money the option is at currently</a> among other things, but if you own the call/put it is always positive as more volatility means more possible upside.</p>\n\n<p>When you sell calls or puts then volatility decreases are good for your position so you are called \"short\" vol.</p>",

		"Title" : "I am currently dealing with the same thing, and have been for a while no...",
		"Body" : "<p>I am currently dealing with the same thing, and have been for a while now. The comments are harsh judgements like you think the asker was given a parenting handbook and that the information provided here is something that only idiots and bad parents don't know. I hear child development and education backgrounds, maybe some psychology/behavioral health. YOU  should know this stuff, yes. Is it something that a normal run-of-the-mill parent should? No. Not unless they bury their face in books and can decide to agree with one of the many conflicting theories of \"good parenting\". </p>\n\n<p>Some of us have no \"good\" examples of how things are supposed to be done and are just trying to not make the same mistakes as our parents. The advice seems valid and well delivered but did it really have to be preceded by implicit scoffs and 'How could you be so stupid\"-like comments?</p>\n\n<p>Expectations are not set too high when you expect your child to do simple tasks without every day being an argument...for EVERY task.</p>\n\n<p>Well let me tell you. I have been dealing with my 10 y/o son not showing interest in ANYTHING and dragging butt about everything in his daily tasks. I have tried everything. I STARTED with explaining why it's important to brush teeth and take a good shower everyday. I asked the exact preferences that were listed here:</p>\n\n<p>\"Do you want to shower at night or in the morning?\" \n\"Do you want to brush your teeth before or after breakfast?\" \n\"Do you want to play for a little while before you start homework?\" \n\"How about after a snack?\"\n\"Do you want to do your homework at the breakfast bar or table?\" \n\"Do you think it would be easier to stay focused or more comfortable if you had a desk in your room? Let's try and see.\" </p>\n\n<p>I have provided encouragement, enforced consequences, provided positive reinforcement, and taken things away. We have time-outs for when either of us get frustrated and we both go to our own spaces to reflect and regroup. I have tried a LOT of different ways to skin this cat. What works for some does not ALWAYS work ALL of the time. I find that as soon as I find something that seems like it is working, it just doesn't and I have to change methods. That has been going on since he was 2 or 3. </p>\n\n<p>I also have an 11 y/o daughter. I have used the same parenting style with her from the beginning. She is autonomous, successful in anything she tries, and interested in everything. She is smart, has great friends, and has great confidence. Different cat.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with some of the comments is that they seem abrasive and sound condescending. Why not ask questions like:\n \"What kind of encouragement have you tried?\"\n\"Which tasks are the most difficult?\"\n\"Have you sat him down when not trying to get him to do something and just asked how he feels about each thing? Why does he think or feel like he does about fulfilling his responsibilities?\" \n\"There have been no \"diagnoses\" in the family but have you considered taking him to speak with someone anyway?\" </p>\n\n<p>Talking to someone that is trained to communicate with children can be helpful. Sometimes it is just an issue of parents not knowing how to communicate with their child. I am still trying to figure it out myself. Kids can be 10 different people by the time they reach double digits. </p>\n\n<p>I say (a couple of years too late) good job for caring enough to seek guidance. We don't have all of the answers and sometimes it takes the wisdom of the village to survive the parent-child relationship. That being said, the villager should be able to ask for the wisdom without feeling attacked. I understand that the asker may have not read the responses that way but I did. So may others that stumble upon this post. All I typed in the search engine was \"how to help my child find interests\". </p>\n\n<p>How about trying to build up or encourage the parent? Do we not still need it? Or, is it a good idea to criticize someone that may already be feeling less-than great about how they're doing in one of life's most challenging tasks? People don't grow out of needing support.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, my son has outgrown the fighting me on things. Most of the time he just complains and whines about everything or will do bare minimum at best without me staying on him. </p>\n\n<p>One thing to help with brushing teeth that parents can try is using the pre-rinse that stains the \"yuk\" on teeth so they see how they're doing. The first time they get it all off before you check is self-rewarding for them. Also, the timed electric toothbrushes help them realize how long it really takes. We use the Sonicare for kids by Phillips. It beeps every 30 seconds letting them know when to switch sections. They can pause it to spit and you can hear it go throught the cycle without having to watch them like a hawk. The vibration tickles for a few days but they get used to it. Another good thing about it is that if they don't put a lot of physical work into it, the toothbrush still gets the job done as long as they actually move it to each part. I'm not endorsing that specific brand, I just don't have knowledge of other brands' features. It is definitely more expensive than regular toothbrushes but for me, worth it in what I save at the dentist. Huge improvement in dental health after the switch.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Briefly, no.</p>\n\n<p>Charged particle interaction is fundamentally a non-instantaneous photon exchange. The interaction can be written or expanded as the ''naive'' instantaneous interaction ($e^2/r$) plus a photon exchange portion which contains exactly a $-e^2/r$ term and a non-instantaneous (retarded in time) term. The author calls the first term the Coulomb interaction, and he calls the second the photon interaction. (We note that the sum of these two results in the cancelling of the instantaneous $e^2/r$ term, giving us a time-dependent expression for charged particle interaction, as expected.)</p>\n\n<p>Then I think the author says that since distances are small, times are also small, and so the instantaneous Coulomb term dominates. Thus it is acceptable in most cases to use the naive 19th century Coulomb definition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit2</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the author is being very semantically confusing, and even contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>The author is using a loose definition of the word \"interaction\" (as was I, before this edit).\nStrictly speaking, the expression \"$e^2/r$\" does not describe an interaction, but rather just tells us the strength of the force. That is, it doesn't say at all <em>how</em> the force arises, it just describes the end result. (Note the analogy to Newtonian vs Einsteinian gravity.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus you would call it the Coulomb Law; \"Coulomb Interaction\" is something that does not exist, or has not yet been proposed (since it would be an instantaneous action-at-a-distance mechanism). As far as we know, all charged particle interaction takes place by exchanging photons. (You could call the exchange of photons the \"Coulomb Interaction\", but then there wouldn't be the distinction that the author makes.)</p>\n\n<p>The author is essentially trying to say that we can ignore the mechanism by which the charged particles interact, and study only the resultant forces and effects arising from their interaction.\nIt would be acceptable, in my opinion, to ignore that somewhat misleading paragraph of the text.</p>",

		"Title" : "Removing entire lines from text with regex, ignoring duplicates and only leaving lines according to criteria",
		"Body" : "<p>I've been working on a project to manipulate text files in c# into something usable that I can pull into excel as a CSV.  I asked another question a few weeks ago which was a definite step in the right direction, however I have some additional constraints that I am trying to figure out.</p>\n\n<p>Link to previous question for background: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23684844/regex-between-and-including-characters-across-multiple-lines/23686350?noredirect=1#comment36992448_23686350\">Original Question</a></p>\n\n<p>The input text file (an example of which is below) has several types of data associated with documents that are stored in a database.  The data is broken into sections for each document, which is denoted by a \"BEGIN:\".  The original regular expression removed most of the line breaks, removed data labels, as well as a line labeled \"Ad Hoc\" which I elected to remove because it was not present in every file, so when I brought it into excel it would misalign the columns.</p>\n\n<p>After looking at additional text files that were the output of this database, I have discovered that there are more inconsistencies, so since I really only need 2 or 3 pieces of data from this, I think it would be easiest to remove everything except what is needed.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to use pipes (which I have come to understand is an \"or\" operator in regex) to try to add additional conditions to the expression, but once I added more than one additional condition it would start to skip the following conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my requirements, and below I will paste in example text:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I only need 2 data items from each document section: Document Handle and FileName.</li>\n<li>At the bottom of the text file there is an additional portion of the file path denoted by \"\\\"</li>\n<li>In some text files, filename and the path at the bottom are repeated, but are the same</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The text files which are the output of the document database we are using is pretty useless as it is.  My goal is to be able to pull something into excel which has the document handle and filename for each document (each section starting with \"BEGIN:\" is a separate document) and the complete file path at the bottom.  So far I have been using a semicolon to deliniate the text when pulling it into excel.</p>\n\n<p>Sample Text:</p>\n\n<pre><code>>>>>Self Configuring Tagged DIP<<<<\nBEGIN:\n>>DocTypeName: System

Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private int jumpPointer;\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchDown(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if((x > (5*width)/7 && y < (2*height)/7)) {\n        controller.jumpPressed(); //make the character jump\n        jumpPointer = pointer;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchUp(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if (pointer == jumpPointer && Gdx.app.getType().equals(ApplicationType.Android))\n        controller.jumpReleased();\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, pointer is a bit oddly named in my opinion.  TouchIndex would probably have made more sense, especially with pointer having a pair of very well defined meanings already.  The pointer value is value between 0 and n (defined as 20 in LibGDX, in reality much lower) that represents the ORDER in which the touch event occurred in the event of multiple simultaneous touches.  Therefore if you have multiple fingers touching, a pointer value of 0 would indicate that this touch event represents the first finger to touch the screen, while a value of 3 would be the fourth finger to touch the screen.</p>",

You need to address these things:</p>\n\n<h2>Forensics</h2>\n\n<p>Have you managed to work out how you were comprimised before?  If not, it would be a good place to start.  Knowing how your system ended up with a RAT on it in the first place means you can close off that door</p>\n\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned by a few others, firewall that stuff.  A box running two NICs and using   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall\" rel=\"nofollow\">UFW</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iptables</a> to filter traffic is a good start, although make sure that box is itself very locked down.  Consider whether you need to run each service on the firewall box too.  e.g. if it's in the same room as you, does it need SSH/telnet running, or can you just use it in person?</p>\n\n<h2>IDS/IPS</h2>\n\n<p>If you consider it necessary, you could even add an Intrusion Protection/Detection System to the box.  There are <a href=\"https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/security-essentials/open-source-intrusion-detection-tools-a-quick-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">several freeware tools</a> to consider in this regard.</p>\n\n<h2>System hardening</h2>\n\n<p>Both on the box you proxy through, and the box you develop on, consider some hardening.  Get a software firewall that is good for your OS, and antivirus for that OS too, and ideally some way to check regularly for Rootkits etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Good practices</h2>\n\n<p>More important than any of the above is to adopt good practices.  It's no good setting up a hardware firewall if you then open ports whenever something doesn't work, and forget to address whether they need to stay open, and it's no good installing a rootkit finder if you never run it.</p>\n\n<p>All of this said, base what you do on a risk assessment (useful to know how previous exploits worked for risk assessment, too), and don't go overboard.  You could spend a week building a nice little setup with custom hardware firewalls, IDS/IPS protection, hardware level AV, and all manner of other stuff, but if you'd do better with a simpler set up and spending that time working, consider whether that's a better idea.</p>\n\n<h2>Audit</h2>\n\n<p>Try and find a decent security audit tool for your system.  If you are running linux, I find <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/tiger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tiger</a> is pretty good, </p>\n\n<h2>Opportunism</h2>\n\n<p>The likelihood is that you weren't targeted.  Statistically speaking, people trying to make money out of security holes in a criminal way (like holding code to ransom) aren't seeking out particular individuals to exploit, but rather people who fit a certain demographic.  It's more likely that you were exploited last time because some script kiddie could find a dev server of some sort running or something like that, and was scanning for these particular things in order to perform the exploit on you that they did.  Your biggest aim is to make yourself hard to find and then target, as this is a much more likely scenario than a direct target of you and only you.  The other thing that makes me think this is that you were extorted for money, whereas a targetted attack would probably be trying to steal your code and keep it.</p>\n\n<p>Consider whether you may have been targeted, but I think on the whole, closing any security holes you can find will be a good first step.  I think you can probably avoid this problem again with just the firewall, but a lot depends on how you were comprimised.</p>",

Since the column count is on the high side (even though the max column count is 1000 i think 200 is high side) I can create a new table with the primary key columns and my new column or I can add the new column to the existing table. Which will be performance wise better. Which will be overall better design. If you can elaborate and lead me for more information it would be better. Thanks in advance.</p>",

		"Title" : "Play Audio on Android",
		"Body" : "<p>Answers to many questions about this theme doesn't help me! It's not the problem that audio needs to be started first by a click or any other type of action.</p>\n\n<p>I want to Play a number of different short mp3's on my website. The best approach I've found is the following. It works on Internet Explorer and Chrome (other Desktop browsers not tested) and on mobile devices with iOS. But not on Android.</p>\n\n<p>In my html I initialize an audio device:</p>\n\n<pre><code><audio id=\"mp3play\" src=\"\"></audio>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's only for defining the name \"mp3play\".</p>\n\n<p>In the header of the html I have the following javascript:</p>\n\n<pre><code><SCRIPT language=JavaScript> \n<!--\nfunction play(name) {\n        var oAudio = document.getElementById(\"mp3play\");\n        oAudio.stop;\n        oAudio.src = name;\n        oAudio.play();\n}\n\n//-->\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now I can invoke the player with the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('stuff/voc/WAVvow/011001.MP3');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine, even on Android.</p>\n\n<p>But for special requirements I do not use filenames for mp3's. I've made a Perl script to deliver the pm3 data depending on a computation. For this I use the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('../cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This Perl code \"playmp3.pl\" sends a header and then the complete mp3 data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ($entry[0] has a pointer to the desired data, $entry[1] the length)\n    open(DAT, \"<../wbtde/DictData/dv8.dat\");\n    binmode DAT;\n    seek(DAT, $entry[0], 0);\n    read(DAT, $mp3, $entry[1]);       # Lesen des Eintrages\n    close DAT;\n    print \"Content-type: audio/mpeg\\n\\n\"; \n    print $mp3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this works fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browsers, but not on Android. </p>\n\n<p>I can invoke the script also directly with</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this is working fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browser, but not on Android. Android tells me it can not play this type of content. But with content type audio/mpeg3 it's also not playing.</p>\n\n<p>This is the Android error log when I tap one link only:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another try:\nI've saved the output from Perl script to a file with the name \"test.MP3\". Then I've prepared a link in my html as</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('stuff/test.MP3');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works on Android! So I can assume that the output of the Perl script is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Is it a question of content type?</p>\n\n<p>Is it a question of the filename (.pl instead of mp3)?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Finally, solved the problem. It appears VMware takes a very different path. The question was misconstrued.</p>\n\n<p>First, I traced the connection using WireShark, and at no point the server asks (need or  want) a certificate. However, VirtualCenter (VC) does provide a way to register a certificate as part of a connection and then use that certificate authenticate. For this to work, they provide a way to tunnel connections.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence I used is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First specify the URL to connect to as https://: (note the protocol is secure, but the port is not).</p></li>\n<li><p>The initial socket will be opened to the clear text port. But having https as the protocol will force calling my own SSLSocketFactory. In my socket factory, I get a call to my <code>public Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)</code> method, which allows me to convert my socket to SSLSocket to my taste.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My code essentially looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)\n    throws IOException {\n    s.setKeepAlive(true);\n    String connectReq = \"CONNECT /sdkTunnel HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\n    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\n    writer.write(connectReq, 0, connectReq.length());\n    writer.flush();\n    // In this initial response, all that matters is the http code. If\n    // it is 200, the rest can be ignored.\n    READ_AND_VERIFY_INITIAL_RESPONSE();\n    SSLSocket sock = (SSLSocket) origSslSockFactory\n        .createSocket(s, s.getInetAddress().getHostName(), s.getPort(), true);\n    // Depending on whether the caller actually does the handshake\n    // or not, you may need to call handshake here. In my case, I\n    // did not need to, since HTTPClient I am using calls the\n    // handshake. Axis does not call, so you may have to in that\n    // case.\n\n    // sock.startHandshake();\n    return sock;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above block, origSslSockFactory is the SSLSocketFactory that got replaced by your implementation. In my case it was an instance of sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketFactoryImpl.</p>\n\n<p>After that procedure, calling ExtensionManager.setExtensionCertificate() succeeds. And subsequently, all calls to SessionManager.loginExtensionByCertificate() also succeeds. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to post this as there seem to be a lot of questions about this.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Many thanks to all of you! I think you all have good points, and the real answer to my question would be a combination of these.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: Economic or climatic (lack of ressources) pressures couldn't do the trick</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy point out above, these types of pressure can only force a population drop for a limited amount of time. Indeed when the humans are less numerous, then the pressure fades and restrained fertility rise again.<br>\nAs the population is spread on a lot of planets, the risk for a great catastrophe to kill enough humans at once to get passed the minimal amount for specie perpetuation is also really unlikely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: It's all about culture!</strong><br>\nAs @Mark remarks in his answer, even if the mainstream culture discourages having lots of children, in time it would be replaced by the subcultures with higher fertility rates.<br>\nEven if global human fertility is decreasing, (for w/e reason) the individuals from the fertile subcultures willing to have children will try everything in order to do so, and probably succeed thanks to advanced science. (in vitro fecondation and so on) As @Vincent points out, individuals mostly do see their interest before such things as their specie's destiny.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes: It would require intervention of a greater institution or entity</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy emphasise, the only way to go past these barriers is to postulate that an extremely well informed and patient institution or entity works in the shadows to lower the overall fertility (using viruses or chemicals) and break the most fertile subcultures. (using manipulation)<br>\nI think we proved here that this is necessary as else evolution or fertile subcultures (that we can see as a social mutation towards specie surviving) would always take over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative possibility: coincidences</strong><br>\nThe only other way is if an extremely unlucky chain of coincidences happens. For example first the economic pressure makes couples less eager to procreate, then a few catastrophic events dynamite the most fertile subcultures, while a very hardcore sect takes over...<br>\nWith the dramatic combination of all these economic, climatic and cultural factors, humanity could end up being a very infertile and fanatic small group of individuals.</p>",

		"Title" : "MySQL replication error when an event is expired and dropped automatically",
		"Body" : "<p>I have an event that ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00, and a replication error was caused by <code>drop event ***</code> statement, coz the slave complains that the event does not exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit more background: we have about 10 MySQL master/slave pairs, each running independently, with identical config(all managed by chef). An event was created previously on all masters, and when the event expired, half of the slaves has a replication error, caused by the <code>drop event</code> statement, while the other half were fine. I checked with one pair of master/slave, both binlog and relay log shows there was a <code>drop event</code> statement at about 2014-01-21 10:06:00(the event actually ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00), while the 'fine' ones seem not having the <code>drop event</code> statement at all.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html</a>, the event is supposed to be immediately dropped once is has expired. </p>\n\n<p>So I did a simple test. First create an event on master, I can see both master and slave has this event, while the status of that event on the slave is 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED', which is expected. </p>\n\n<pre><code>DELIMITER |\nDROP EVENT IF EXISTS `test_event` |\nCREATE EVENT `test_event`\nON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 MINUTE STARTS '2015-01-22 15:45:00' ENDS '2015-01-22 15:48:00'\n  DO BEGIN\n    insert into t values ();\n  END |\nDELIMITER ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At 15:48, the event on both master & slave was gone. I check the binlog and relay log, both show that there was a <code>DROP EVENT test.test_event</code> at 2015-01-22 15:48:00, which looks quite fine.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: \n1. Among the 10 master/slave pairs, any idea why half the master did not execute <code>drop event ***</code> at all when the event expired, while the other half did, but late for several minutes, and the event on the slave is already gone(while a simple test worked just as expected)? Or where should I look at besides the binlog and relay log?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>All events on the slaves are gone already, those without a replication error doesn't have the <code>drop event</code> statement in relay log at all. So how did those event gone in the first place?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>PS: MySQL version is 5.5.29-29.4-log Percona Server</p>",

		"Title" : "What is the proper way to organize those connections between classes in OOP",
		"Body" : "<p>There is some pattern in my code, that I have rather often, but never know how to organize those classes properly. Let's look at the most recent (simplified) example. It is written in C#, but I would assume that the \"solution\" generally applies to any OOP language. </p>\n\n<p>There are 3 classes: <code>Planet</code>, <code>Storage</code> and <code>Population</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Each <code>Planet</code> can have a Population and may have one or several Storages, with one being the main one. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>Population</code> among other things also has to eat, and for that draws the food from the main Storage of the Planet. This happens when the <code>Planet.Update()</code> is called, which then again also calls <code>Population.Update()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now my question is, how to properly model those connections between those 3 classes. I personally see a few options, but I'm not sure, which is the right one.</p>\n\n<p>a) Not make a separate Storage and Population class, but do it all in the Planet class. - This feels crude and unhandy, especially as those classes are quite big and merging all those, only because there is a very small overlap (small compared to the overall functionality of those classes), feels simply wrong.</p>\n\n<p>b) Each time <code>Population.Update()</code> is called, give the reference to the Storage as Parameter. - This is, what I am doing right now. It feels like a lot of redundancy and useless cluttering of the <code>Population.Update()</code>-signature though. Pretty much this parameter will be identical to the last call 99.99% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>c) Store permanently in the Population, from which Storage it should draw. - This targets the complaint I had with b), but brings new problems. Now I have to remember, that every time I change the main storage of the Planet, I also have to tell this to the Population. (or for whatever other reasons the used storage of the Planet changes) I have no doubt, I would remember doing that, if I were to change the Planet class in the next few weeks, but if I decide to work on it again in a year, I may run into troubles, because I forgot it.</p>\n\n<p>d) Store permanently in the Population, to which Planet it belongs, and add a method to the Planet, that returns a reference to its main storage. - This is sort of a mix between b) and c). It cleans up the signature of my <code>Population.Update()</code> and does not run into the troubles I see with c), but of course it requires a mostly redundant method call to get the <code>Storage</code> each time <code>Population.Update()</code> is called.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At least in the US, graduate admissions committees tend to look at many factors. The three \"big\" areas tend to be your recommendation letters, personal statement, and standardized scores. They probably will look at your CV as well. You might be able to make up for a deficit in one area with strengths in other areas. For example, admissions committees might favor an applicant with at least one published paper prior to his/her application, even if he/she does not have the best GPA or GRE scores out of the entire applicant pool. I am less familiar with admissions outside of the US.Unfortunately, there isn't any one magic formula to guarantee admission to any program.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I think you are correct in wondering how your GRE score will impact your chances of admission. Assuming that you took the most updated form of the GRE (where the range is 130-170 instead of 200-800 for each section), your score is quite low since you scored 35 points above the absolute minimum score. Most competitive graduate programs claim that successful applicants have GRE scores in at least the 50th percentile. As such, your low GRE score would likely be a major red flag for these programs. However, other programs tend to overlook GRE scores entirely (they will say you don't need to submit them) or weight them fairly low.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way that you can postpone your applications and retake the GRE? If not, you need to put together the best application possible, which means putting extra effort and attention into the other parts of your application, like your personal statement. You might also consider applying to programs that explicitly do not require standardized scores or weigh them low, which means that if the GRE is the only weak point of your application, you're likely fine. Again, there is no way of any of us knowing what you can do to guarantee admission, but in your situation, I would suggest that you make the things still within your control the best they can be.</p>",

		"Title" : "Well, I planned to just write the relevant parts of the program but I en...",
		"Body" : "<p>Well, I planned to just write the relevant parts of the program but I ended up writing an entire working program instead. Since I don't know how much Python you know I'm just going to explain the entire program; sorry if I have a somewhat pedantic and/or pompous air. Feel free to just skip to the bottom and copy the code.</p>\n\n<p>The code I wrote demonstrates 4 Python idioms: object oriented design, bytearray/string slicing and formatting, the xrange() function, and error catching.</p>\n\n<p>I think that csv would not be a good angle to approach the problem with. I opted to store the data as a text table. Each line takes the following form:\n30 characters name | 10 characters total score | 9 characters attempts | 1 newline\nThe benefit of this is that each line is exactly 50 characters wide. So, unlike the csv approach, we don't have to scan through for commas to find relevent data; we just go through the data in increments of 50 characters. This makes for much more readable code, and it's not like text storage space is at a premium these days.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Chell R earned 42 points in 5 attempts becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"                       Chell R        42        5\\n\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since we're going to be sorting  this data later, it would be advantageous to store both the student's name and his/her score in an object. This object makes sorting much simpler; because the name is permanently attatched to the score, we don't have to worry about making sure the name data follows the score data as the data is sorted. It just happens implicitly.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first portion of the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import time, random, operator\ndirectory_name = r\"C:\\Users\\YOU\\yourDirectoryHere\\\\\"\n#When you change the directory name, be SURE to include\n#the double backslash at the end.\ndatafile = open(directory_name + \"scores.txt\")\ndata = bytearray(datafile.read())\ndatafile.close()\n\nclass entry():\n    def __init__(self, i):\n        #i is the location of the student's entry in the data.\n        global data\n        self.name = data[i:i + 30]\n        self.total = int(data[i + 30:i + 40])\n        self.attempts = int(data[i + 40:i + 49])\n        if self.attempts:\n            self.average = float(self.total) / self.attempts\n        else: self.average = 0.0\n\n    def update_score(self, score, i):\n        global data, directory_name\n        self.total += score\n        self.attempts += 1\n        self.average = float(self.total) / self.attempts\n        data[i + 30: i + 40] = \"%10i\" % self.total\n        data[i + 40: i + 49] = \"%9i\" % self.attempts\n        datafile = open(directory_name + \"scores.txt\",'w')\n        datafile.write(data)\n        datafile.close()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method defined under <strong>init</strong> is known as a magic method. This means that unlike the regular method update_score, you don't call the method yourself. It's automatically called by Python; in this case it's called when an entry object is created.</p>\n\n<p>Five things to point out:\n1: Just to quickly explain a syntax annoyance, each method must have self as the first argument and each variable stored in the object needs a self. prefix.</p>\n\n<p>2: Notice that the data read from the file is converted to the bytearray type. Bytearrays are useful because unlike strings they are mutable, so we can update students' scores when neccessary without inefficiently recreating the entire string. I opted to pass data as a global variable instead of a regular argument in order to avoid having to pass it through several layers of functions.</p>\n\n<p>3: The expression foo = bar[x:y] is a slice operation. This means \"Fill variable foo with characters x through y-1 of bar\". I used it in the <strong>init</strong> function in order to initialize the entry's name and score values. The reverse also works, as seen in the update_score method.</p>\n\n<p>4: Another useful trick for string or bytearray formatting inherits from C. Since each total score entry must take up 10 characters in order to keep each entry 50 characters wide, use the string \"%10i\" % self.total in order to force the interger to a 10 character width.</p>\n\n<p>5: Finally, just a quick note that I wrote float(self.total) / self.attempts. Dividing an integer by an integer results in a rounded, inaccurate integer.</p>\n\n<p>The next part of the program is the main play() function, which calls find_entry():</p>\n\n<pre><code>def find_entry(name):\n    global data\n    for i in xrange(0,len(data),50):\n        if data[i:i + 30] == \"%30s\" % name:\n            return i\n    print \"Name not found. Please check the spelling of your name.\"\n    print \"If you spelled your name correctly please ask your teacher for help.\"\n    return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The xrange function is first seen in the find_entry function. This provides a much more readable, pythonic way to iterate than while loops. \"for i in xrange(0,len(data),50):\" is equivalent to. \"i = 0; While i < len(data): ... i += 50. Anyway, all it does is go through the data 50 characters at a time (since each entry is 50 characters wide) and check if the first 30 characters match up with the inputted name. (Note that I use data[i:i + 30] == \"%30s\" % name. The inputted name must be pumped up to 30 characters, otherwise the equality operator will always fail). It returns the index i of the found entry if successful and returns None to indicate failure.</p>\n\n<p>Next we'll examine the main play() function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def play():\n    global data\n    entry_num = None\n    while entry_num == None:\n        entry_num = find_entry(raw_input(\"Please enter your name and surname initial (e.g. William G): \"))\n\n    student_entry = entry(entry_num)\n    score = 0\n    for i in xrange(10): #same as xrange(0,10,1)\n        score += question()\n\n    student_entry.update_score(score, entry_num)\n    print \"Your score this time was %i / 10\" % score\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see here that the fact that find_entry returns None upon failure is put to good use. The while loop means the program keeps on trying until a valid name is inputted. Also note the use of the raw_input function. This forces Python to interpret the input as a string. This'll make more sense in the next function, the question function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def question():\n    n1 = random.randint(1,9)\n    n2 = random.randint(1,9)\n    ops = {'+': operator.add, '-': operator.sub, 'x': operator.mul}\n    op = random.choice(ops.keys())\n    answer = raw_input(\"What is %i %s %i?  \" % (n1, op, n2))\n    try: \n        answer = int(answer)\n        if answer == ops[op](n1, n2):\n            print \"Well done\"\n            return 1\n        else:\n            print \"incorrect, %i %s %i = %i\" % (n1, op, n2, ops[op](n1,n2))\n            return 0\n    except ValueError:\n        print \"'%s' does not appear to be a number.\" % answer\n        return 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I pretty much just copied your code verbatim for this part. The only major difference is the addition of the try... except statement and the use of raw_input() in lieu of input(). The issue with input() is that it's pretty unsafe, since Python is free to interpret its input as any type, including a variable name, a bogus input can wreck all sorts of havoc. raw_input is much safer: since Python always interprets the input as a string the programmer gets the right to interpret the input and anticipate errors. In this case, the try... except statement tries to convert the inputted string to an integer with int(). int() raises ValueError if it fails to convert the string to an integer, so an except ValueError statement would execute instead upon failure, communicating the failure to the user and allowing the program to recover instead of crashing.</p>\n\n<p>Now that that's dealt with, we can move on to the actually interesting part of the question: sorting the entries.</p>\n\n<p>Going back to the entry() class definition, there are two additional magic methods which facilitate leaderboard creation, <strong>cmp</strong> and <strong>str</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class entry():\n    def __init__(self, i):\n        ...\n\n    def __cmp__(self, other):\n        return self.average - other.average\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return \"%s | %2.2f\" % (self.name, self.average)\n\n    def update_score(self, score, i):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <strong>cmp</strong> method is called when Python needs to compare two entries. Since we want the leaderboards to be sorted by average score, not alphabetically or by total score, we return a comparison of this entry's average with the other entry's average (Python interprets a negative return value as self < other and a positive return value as self > other)</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>str</strong> method is what's called when str(a) or print(a) is encountered, where a is an entry type. Since we now must format two pieces of data, the student's name and average, we put the two variables in a tuple after the % sign. The %2.2f tells Python to print a floating point number with only 2 digit after the decimal point; any further digits are ignored.</p>\n\n<p>All the work was done writing the methods. Writing the leaderboard() function thus becomes a trivial affair:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def leaderboard():\n    global data\n    entries = []\n    for i in xrange(0, len(data),50):\n        entries += [entry(i)]\n\n    entries.sort()\n    entries.reverse()\n\n    for i in entries:\n        print i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see the beauty of object oriented programming at work here. The xrange loop calls the entry's <strong>init</strong> method over and over again, populating the list with entries. This somewhat complex function is safely stowed away in the entry class declaration, keeping the leaderboard function clean and easy to read. Next, the sort() method of Python's built in list object is called, so we don't need to reinvent the wheel writing another sorting algorithm. This calls our <strong>cmp</strong> function, ensuring that Python will correctly sort the entries by average score as intended. Next, we reverse() the list, since we want the highest scores first. Again, no need to write this function ourselves; it comes along with the list type in Python. Finally, we print the leaderboard. This calls the entry class's <strong>str</strong> function, so in the leaderboard function itself we don't need to worry about finding the correct data in the data file. Nice and clean.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much done here, now all there's to do is write the main loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while True:\n    print \"\"\"\\\nWelcome to Simple-Maths Questions program\nPlease type one of the following:\nPlay | Leaderboard | Exit\"\"\"\n    command = raw_input()\n    command = command.upper()\n    if command in \"PLAY\":\n        play()\n    elif command in \"LEADERBOARD\":\n        leaderboard()\n    elif command in \"EXIT\":\n        break #You don't have to call quit() to terminate the program, just reach EOF.\n    elif command in \"ADD NAME\":\n        add_student()\n    else:\n        print \"unknown command\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, raw_input() is safer than input(). The keyword is converted to all caps and only finds whether the input is in the keyword, so the input is not case sensitive and there's no need to type the full keyword (This was a timesaver for debugging). Also, there's the hidden command \"ADD NAME\"; I didn't feel like explaining that function. And that's, uh, pretty much all I have to say.</p>\n\n<p>And here is the completed code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import time, random, operator\ndirectory_name = r\"C:\\Users\\YOU\\yourDirectoryHere\\\\\"\n#When you change the directory name, be SURE to include\n#the double backslash at the end.

I want to learn microcontroller having speed greater than 16Mhz and can easily be interfaced with usb . So what type of microcontroller should i start learning and which book should you prefer for me having programming lesson and basic hardware startup for this type of microcontroller. Thanks</p>",

		"Title" : "In the case of rack equipment in data centers, we put the target port an...",
		"Body" : "<p>In the case of rack equipment in data centers, we put the target port and source port on every label - preferably in two lines.  It's reversed on the opposite end of the cable.  For example if I have a server CALPROD1 and I'm plugging into the iLo and on the other end I'm coming from switch CALSW035, blade 3, port 2, the labels would look like this...</p>\n\n<p>SERVER SIDE:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CALPROD1 /ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CALSW035 /3.2</strong></p>\n\n<p>SWITCH SIDE:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CALSW35 /3.2</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CALPROD1 /ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are several benefits to this.  Firstly, if service has to be performed and the cables need to be removed (like a chassis has to be pulled to replace a board or add memory, etc.) the engineer knows exactly where the cable came from and where to plug it back in.  From a tracing perspective, you know exactly where the this cable is going on the other end - patch panel, switch, another server, etc.  Sometimes we even put the cabinet info. Example: <strong>[A42] CALPROD1 / ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p>I merge all my labels from spreadsheet using the USB to a brother p-touch.  Their extra sticky labels are great in high-heat situations (like the back of servers) and their flexible ID tape is great for creating flags by wrapping cables.  If you use the \"regular\" labels in high heat, the lamination comes undone because it wants to return to flat while the white backer remains wrapped.</p>\n\n<p>When you have 40+ flags to put on, (often after you've already cabled stuff up), it's a real pain to get two sticky things to line up perfectly straight and without any creases or wrinkles.  The flags hardly ever come out like they look in the pictures.  <strong>IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A TRICK TO DOING FLAGS, PLEASE ADVISE!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd love to label parallel to the cable and then put a clear shrink sleeve over it but we cannot use anything like a heat gun or torch in a production data center.  Plus cables need to be unplugged in order to thread the sleeve.  Often times we're under a time crunch so cable dressing and labeling come after the system's spinning.</p>\n\n<p>Panduit flags are awesome to stick labels on (even the basic labels).  have to zip tie them but it's quick and easy to do even on active connections.  Cables are no longer \"snag less\" and Panduit tags cost more that the CAT5e cables themselves!  WTF?  Can't these be made overseas for practically free?</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Great discussion!  Thanks!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I wanted to comment but since i can't...</p>\n\n<p>Are you talking about the energy generation to produce fertilizer ? Then of course you can go non-fossil sources...you can use the sun the wind the water i think that if it is a closed environment you can even use the methane you generate to generate your own power</p>\n\n<p>But what you should ask yourself is do you really need industrialized fertilizer at all? Look to the nature plants have been there in abundance for a long time you can get all you need free from the nature.</p>\n\n<p>The overall fertility and viability of the soil, rather than the application of fertilizers as quick fixes, is at the very heart of organic gardening.</p>\n\n<p>Many organic materials serve as both fertilizers and soil conditioners\u2014they feed both soils and plants. This is one of the most important differences between a chemical approach and an organic approach toward soil care and fertilizing. Soluble chemical fertilizers contain mineral salts that plant roots can absorb quickly. However, these salts do not provide a food source for soil microorganisms and earthworms, and will even repel earthworms because they acidify the soil. Over time, soils treated only with synthetic chemical fertilizers lose organic matter and the all-important living organisms that help to build a quality soil. As soil structure declines and water-holding capacity diminishes, more and more of the chemical fertilizer applied will leach through the soil. In turn, it will take ever-increasing amounts of chemicals to stimulate plant growth. When you use organic fertilizers, you avoid throwing your soil into this kind of crisis condition.</p>\n\n<p>Use earthworms they are really good for the health of any soil and they are a free infinite fertilizer productor.</p>\n\n<p>Also you can try to plant a few spare leguminous plants on your farm because they take the nitrogen from air and put it on the ground avaible for other plant's to use if did right you won't  need to add nitrogen never again just le the nature do the job!</p>\n\n<p>I will stop here you can find much more about organics fertilizer and how to organic care not only your plants but your soil too on google</p>",

I'm using Volley, of course.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private List<ConversationsModel> conversationsList = new ArrayList<ConversationsModel>();\n\nConversationsRequest = MainPageActivity.instance().ConversationsRequest(ConversationURL, mPullToRefreshLayout);\n        MainController.getInstance().addToRequestQueue(ConversationsRequest);\n\n        conversationsList.clear();\n\n        ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lastMessages = db.getLastMessages(\"\");\n        PrettyTime p = new PrettyTime();\n\n        for (HashMap<String, String> map : lastMessages) {\n            SimpleDateFormat fmt = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n            Date date;\n\n            ConversationsModel convModel = new ConversationsModel();\n\n            try {\n                date = fmt.parse(map.get(\"vsenderdate\"));\n\n                convModel.setSenddate(p.format(date).toString());\n            } catch (ParseException e) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n\n            convModel.setLasttext(map.get(\"vlasttext\"));\n            convModel.setNum(map.get(\"vphonenumber\"));\n            convModel.setThumbnailUrl(map.get(\"vprofilepic\"));\n            convModel.setUnread(Integer.parseInt(map.get(\"vunread\")));\n            convModel.setUsernameornumber(map.get(\"vcontact\"));\n            convModel.setUniqueid(map.get(\"vuniqueid\"));\n\n            if (map.get(\"vuniqueid\").equals(\"0\")) {\n                convModel.setIsgroup(0);\n            } else {\n                convModel.setIsgroup(1);\n            }\n\n            conversationsList.add(convModel);\n\n            adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>php side is simple json</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"contact\":{\"name\":\"+xxx xxx xxx xxx\"},\"contact_image\":\"image.png\",\"uniqueid\":\"0\",\"num\":\"xxx xxx xxx\",\"lasttext\":\"text goes here...\",\"lastdate\":\"2015-01-21 12:13:59\",\"unread\":0}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I do not want examples how to code. This is simple model that runs inside thread with 30 seconds interval, gets json data, then I clear sQlite database and insert new rows, at least application reads from sQlite database.</p>\n\n<p>When I saw that it was very simple, slow and ugly solution, I made Crontab that retrieves same json data from mysql and stores in .json file. I read data from json file, not directly from database. I became faster, but still killing application.</p>\n\n<p>now I'm going to create some simple web server in C++, that connect to xxx port and gets data. But I think it is not better solution at all. Is there better solution? Should I get data in bytes to make faster or what can I do to application, to exchange data faster between client and server.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>",

Unfortunately, I'm self teaching (I have no professor to ask) and I'm afraid there's no solution companion for Durbin and Koopman (2012)!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199641178.001.0001/acprof-9780199641178-chapter-2?rskey=FZDLQi&result=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exercise 2.13.1 from Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods Second Edition</a></strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Consider the local level model (2.3).</p>\n  \n  <p>(a) Give the model representation for $x_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$, for $t = 2, ..., n$.</p>\n  \n  <p>(b) Show that the model for $x_t$ in (a) can have the same statistical properties as the model given by $x_t = \\epsilon_t + \\theta \\epsilon_{t-1}$ where $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)$, .......</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the record, the local level model (2.3) is given by:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$y_t = \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t \\quad\\quad \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)$</p>\n  \n  <p>$\\alpha_{t+1} = \\alpha_t + \\eta_t \\quad\\quad \\eta_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\eta}^2)$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Doubts about (a)</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, the model proposed in (a) looks like noise (which makes perfect sense since it's the first difference of a random walk). Is the following representation correct?</p>\n\n<p>$$ x_t = y_t - y_{t-1} = \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t - \\alpha_{t-1} - \\epsilon_{t-1} $$\n$$ x_t = \\alpha_{t-1} + \\eta_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t - \\alpha_{t-1} - \\epsilon_{t-1} $$\n$$ x_t = \\eta_{t-1} + \\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t-1}  $$</p>\n\n<p>This makes me doubt. First, state disturbance $\\eta_{t-1}$ is now part of the observation equation. Second, what does the state equation mean now that the observation equation doesn't relate to the unobserved states $\\alpha_t$? Third, and somehow related, what's the mean unobserved state now that $\\alpha_t$ isn't anymore on the formula? Zero?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Doubts about (b)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Additionaly, I wonder how to show that models have the same statistical properties. What do you have to prove to say they're the same? Same expected value and variance of observation $x_t$, unobserved state $\\alpha_t$, prediction error $v_t = x_t - a_t $, filtered unobserved state, updated unobserved state, etc.? Since all random variables are Normal, I guess showing the first two moments match is enough, but a) what distribution (marginal, conditionals, conditionals on what?) of b) what variables (observed, hidden state, prediction error, etc.) should be equal?</p>\n\n<p>Any comment is much appreciated!</p>",

If there is a simpler way, I am sure you will let me know.</p>\n\n<p>In theory these steps should work for any linux distribution, you just need to find the original configure options that are used to compile apache for your distro. Perhaps you could add comments to this answer on where you found the options.</p>\n\n<p>The important option is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>--enable-layout=Debian</code></pre>\n\n<p>Debian can be changed to any one of the supported layouts in config.layout file in the apache build directory, the options are defined as:</p>\n\n<pre><code><Layout x>\n...\n</Layout></code></pre>\n\n<p>Where x would be the layout option. Try googling \"--enable-layout=x\" where x is your distribution to find your options. Try find the original options used by your distro and not some random suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As mentioned by faker the problem with this is that when you upgrade using apt and there is a new version of apache2, the compiled version will be overwritten. His suggestion of building a new deb is a good one. Unfortunately due to various deb dependency issues that are too much work to get around I have not been able to do so. However I would suggest that you try that route first, this should help you:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.wpkg.org/2014/06/29/building-apache-2-4-x-deb-packages-for-debian-wheezy-7-x/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.wpkg.org/2014/06/29/building-apache-2-4-x-deb-packages-for-debian-wheezy-7-x/</a></p>\n\n<p>I've opted to keep it as is, however I have set a hold on apache2 so it is not upgraded till I am ready to release the hold. Alternatively you could just remove apache from the machine and add it again when you are ready.</p>\n\n<p>To hold:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-mark hold apache2</code></pre>\n\n<p>To release hold:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-mark unhold apache2</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would also suggest that you make a clone of the server you wish to change, work through the process on the clone and get it working before trying it on a production env. Breaking apache for a day or longer on a prod environment is not a stress you need in your life. This is where virtual machines are great, take a snapshot and create a new instance from the snapshot.

I have data array consisting of such data in large size. Now I want scrollable graph containing plot of such time and value data. Here is my javascript implementation to do so,</p>\n\n<pre><code>var dataArray; //This contains my data array i.e. ([[t1, v1],[t2, v2],...])\n\nvar minDate = dataArray[0][0];\nvar maxDate = dataArray[dataArray.length - 1][0];\n\nvar chartOption = {\n        chart: {\n            type: graphType,\n            renderTo: 'graph-container',\n            zoomType: 'x',\n            useUTC: false\n        },\n        title: {\n            text: 'Data from last 24 hours'\n        },\n        credits : {\n            enabled: false\n        },\n        xAxis: {\n            title: {\n                text: null\n            },\n            type: 'datetime',\n            dateTimeLabelFormats: {\n                second: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M:%S',\n                minute: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M',\n                hour: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M',\n                day: '%Y<br/>%m-%d',\n                week: '%Y<br/>%m-%d',\n                month: '%Y-%m',\n                year: '%Y'\n            },\n            allowDecimals: false,\n            ordinal: false,\n            min: minDate,\n            max: maxDate\n        },\n        yAxis: {\n            title: {\n                text: null\n            }\n        },\n        plotOptions: {\n            series: {\n                pointStart: minDate,\n                pointInterval: 5 * 60 *1000\n            }\n        },\n        series: [{\n            name: parameterName,\n            data: dataArray\n        }],\n        exporting: {\n            enabled: false\n        }\n    };\n\n    parameterChart = new Highcharts.Chart(chartOption);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The chart shows incorrect data, the time value on x-axis doesn't match the value at y-axis.

		"Body" : "<p>I've been experiencing massive slowdown on my server after launching a new website.</p>\n\n<p>Using MONyog I can see that after an apache/mysql restart, the queries/second starts out nice and low for around 10 minutes, but then creeps up to a rate at which the server massively slows down with some queries hanging for 10 seconds or more.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mojZw.png\" alt=\"MONyog Monitoring Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<p>Through my research I think what is happening is that there are some inefficient queries that cause the creation of some temporary tables on disk, which piles up and reaches the server limits over time and grinds to a hault.</p>\n\n<p>Working my way through the worst offenders I have managed to optimize a lot of queries with the help of some Googling, but my knowledge of optimizing MySQL is very limited and I'm stuck on this particular one that I'm not sure what to do with.</p>\n\n<p>The following is the last slow query in the list, it queries 2 databases; <code>bl_post</code> and <code>cp_data</code>. <code>cp_data</code> is relational. <code>table11.cpda_meta_val</code> holds the published date

The problem is that I'm using pooled data across multiple experiments (not conducted by me). The experiments involve different methodologies and have introduced an un-quantified error into the measurements of CA. So, for example, even if the response to P,T,S in CA is similar across studies the values of CA might be offset between studies because of different amounts of contamination.</p>\n\n<p>How do I account for this error (which is actually lab-based contamination) in the multiple regression model? Would adding the study/experiment as a categorical predictor variable help? Or is there another way?</p>\n\n<p>(Note, I'm not a statistician and am not familiar with the symbology that is often used on this forum...)</p>\n\n<p>Update: After some searching I'm starting to think a Random Effects Model (i.e. Proc TSCSREG is SAS) might be appropriate? Any advice would be great...</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>",

It would be the way to gain maximum control and AFAIK this is required for repeated events that you want to transfer via e.g. <code>org-caldav.el</code>.  The reason is that you need an UID (<em>U</em>nique) for each event to be able to consistently track them (though <code>ox-ical.el</code> does provide such an UID for repeated events set up with e.g. <code>org-class</code> they are ignored by at least <code>org-caldav.el</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> has been part of Emacs for a good many years.

		"Body" : "<p>Suppose I have a number of random variables $X,Y,\\ldots$, and we can assume the joint distribution of these variables is known in advance. I also have an unknown function $f(x,y,\\ldots)$ with corresponding input parameters. The values of $f()$ are obtained by experiment, and we can assume that $f()$ is repeatable (so if I repeat the experiment with the same inputs I get the same answer).</p>\n\n<p>I then take $N$ samples from the random variables, and for each sample $x_i,y_i,\\ldots$ obtain (from an experiment) observations $f_i=f(x_i,y_i,\\ldots)$. I then use least squares regression to estimate a polynomial approximation $\\hat{f}$ to $f$ based on the sample data and observations.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of well established tests for assessing the goodness of fit/estimation error of $\\hat{f}$ and obtaining the covariances of the polynomial coefficients.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows. The random variables $X,Y,\\ldots$ and $\\hat{f}$ are used to estimate a new quantity, $\\hat{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ which is a test statistic of the distribution of $\\hat{f}(X,Y,\\ldots)$ (in fact it is a quantile).</p>\n\n<p>If I had chosen different samples $x_i,y_i,\\ldots$ then I'd end up with a different $\\hat{f}$ and a different $\\hat{Q}$. I would like to calculate the possible effect of estimation error on $\\hat{Q}$ from the uncertainty in estimating the coefficients. </p>\n\n<p>Is this problem as simple as follows? Suppose $\\hat{f}(x,y,\\ldots)=\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}\\cdot x+\\hat{\\beta_2}\\cdot y+\\hat{\\beta_3}\\cdot xy+\\beta_4 \\cdot x^2+\\cdots$ are the polynomial coefficients. I assume that</p>\n\n<p>$\\beta_i\\sim N(\\hat{\\beta_i},\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2)$</p>\n\n<p>where $\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2$ are the sample covariances from my linear model fit and then I have</p>\n\n<p>$Q\\sim N(\\hat{Q},\\sum\\frac{\\partial\\hat{Q}}{\\partial\\beta_i}\\cdot\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2)$</p>\n\n<p>where the sum is taken over all coefficients of linear terms (so ignoring higher order terms in $\\hat{f}$ like $\\beta_3,\\beta_4$). Happily I know $\\partial\\hat{Q}/\\partial\\beta_i$. Hence a confidence interval.</p>\n\n<p>Is this correct? I'm concerned about ignoring the higher order terms in $\\hat{f}$. Are there alternative approaches eg. bootstrapping? or some references you can point me to?</p>",

However, none of these values map to anything that looks like a neatline area of the image, and some of them are beyond the width and height bounds of the image.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I understand correctly, it should be possible to apply some simple linear function to a set of coordinates to convert them into pixel values using the image's GeoTransform metadata.</strong>  MapToPixel should be providing such a transformation.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I can also settle for hearing about GDAL utilities that could crop the image using NEATLINE without warping or rotating it (somehow preventing gdalwarp from doing this or using a different utility altogether).</p>",

It worked for me on an earlier beta release of commerce-kickstart.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I did:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Created three different flat rate shipping services.</li>\n<li>Created a calculation rule.</li>\n<li>First condition: data comparison (Data to compare: [commerce-line-item:type], Data value: Shipping)</li>\n<li>Second condition: entity has field (Entity: [commerce-line-item:order], Field: commerce_customer_shipping)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now I should be able to use \"Order address component comparison\", but it doesn't work.\nI can dpm in actions for the shipping-line-item and can see the country-code, but I don't find a way to get it compared.</p>\n\n<p>I tried it with \"data comparison\" rule, but it seems, I can't get deep enough in the array to get the correct field. I can dpm this: <code>commerce-line-item:order:commerce-customer-shipping</code>, and I see the country code here: <code>->commerce_customer_address['en'][0]['country']</code>, but I don't find a way to use it for comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there is an easy solution with executing custom php code in rules to compare the countries?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Maybe the problem has to do with field translation. The customer profile types billing and shipping information have field translation on. I tried to disable translation, but after next test order it was enabled again.</p>\n\n<p>Then I checked the database fields for address management and found something strange. In field_data_commerce_customer_address table the language is 'en', but in field_data_commerce_customer_billing and -shipping it is 'und'.</p>\n\n<p>If I switch page language to english, the checkout finishes without error.\nIf site language is german, the addresses are not shown on checkouts review page, and on complete page I get errors from presave function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Undefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 522 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 523 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nInvalid argument supplied for foreach() in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 532 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 522 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 523 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nInvalid argument supplied for foreach() in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 532 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can someone help me with that?

		"Body" : "<p>You have to differ two things:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A)</strong> The hash function as a function to transform a given set of information input to a well defined set of output. If you look at this aspect of a hashing function, it has to solve two problems:</p>\n\n<p>1) It should be designed to avoid collisions - it would be a mess, if you have a high collision rate because it would be easier to \"guess\" the password. Think of a  function which sums up every ASCII-Position of every char input: the <em>outcome</em> for \u00BBab\u00AB is the same as for \u00BBba\u00AB. So this would be really a very bad choice.</p>\n\n<p>2) It should be deterministic so that you could reproduce the result. \nHashes are used for comparison. So it should be clear, that a function, which has no deterministic output is useless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B)</strong> The use of a hashing-algorithm in the context of storing passwords in a database. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is hashing safe if a given string always generates the same hash?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From (A) it is clear, that, since the output is deterministic a possible attack vector would be to use premade/-calculated hashes aka <em>Rainbow-Tables</em>. </p>\n\n<p><em>simple example:</em></p>\n\n<p>Say, your password is \"hello world\". The <em>MD5</em>-Sum is: <em>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em>. \nGoogling (our \u00BB<em>Rainbow table</em>\u00AB for the sake of the example) for that checksum leads you to <a href=\"http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/lookaside/extras/koji/hello/6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> location, where you find a file, whose content is \"hello world\". So simply hashing isn't enough. A way to improve security is to use a salt (which could be stored alongside the hash). In our case, let's add <em>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em> (the <em>MD5</em>-sum of the previous example) to the passphrase => \u00BB<em>hello world6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em>\u00AB. The new MD5 is <em>f59c64e092edb4fbc2904a3b28ce88c5</em>. If you google that, you have no results. </p>\n\n<p>Beware: I am not(!) suggesting, using <em>MD5</em> in this way is in any way \"<em>secure</em>\" - but I used it to exemplify how a salt affects the outcome of a hashing function. Although the hash is calculated deterministically, the output for one password and two different salts is different enough to make the \"<em>guessing</em>\"-part a bit harder.</p>",

		"Title" : "Your question is quite unclear. On the wall, there are multiple classes ...",
		"Body" : "<p>Your question is quite unclear. On the wall, there are multiple classes of brothers:\n1-Kind of civilians: Builders, cooks, maesters and assistants. This kind of brothers is not deemed fit to train for arms, and most of the cases, the masters in arms<br>\n2-Soldiers : This is the most common type of brothers on the wall, they are trained to wield a sword and perhaps use a bow and arrow. Their day to day tasks are to mount gards on the wall and engage enemy in defense of the wall.\nNB: the first and second category are very close, and their tasks may be confused, and some sources mention that :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every man in the Watch walks the wall, and all are expected to bare steel in its defense, but the rangers are the true fighting men of the Watch (I: 372)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However we never heard of Sam Tarly walking the wall. So...</p>\n\n<p>3-Rangers: These are the gifted unfortunate, that have joined the wall for one reason or another. They're hence given the toughest quests. Rangers often dwell behind the wall, and seldom on it. They are generally good trackers and stealth masters. They know very well their way in the land of the far north. Qhorin Halfhand and Benjen Stark are very known rangers.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the armour now that is the core of your question. The first category doesn't require one, so what they wear around is what keeps them warmest, so any kind of animal fur or skin or leather would do.(I am not taking into consideration the latest events on the wall were resources were scarce and everybody engaged in battle).\nRecruits of the Watch wear often </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>roughspun black (I: 149)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>because such described wear is hard to get by and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns (I: 150)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second category, is the one destined more for battle. However, they prefer boiled leather to any other protection. The main reason behind that is that steel is cold, and gets colder with the cold of the north, can even cause problems during long watches. \nThe third category, is the rangers'. Well this category even though it seems to be the most danger exposed one, is the least worried about protection, for several reasons. If they go detected on their reckon missions, no kind of armour would save them. If they stay exposed in the cold with heavy armour, they'd die of cold. So they prefer skin. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rangers often share skins for warmth (III: 169)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OJkKM.jpg\" alt=\"Qhorin Halfhand by Matt Olson\"></p>\n\n<p>Oh, and of course, all these categories have cloaks of course, black washed out cloaks. \nAnd before I end my answer (which cannot really be considered as answer for lack of details about the question) I have to add that in order to answer this question properly, we need to study the armour of the free folks. They're more exposed to war than the black watch, and they're accustomed to war in cold. Some have bones for armour, some boiled leather, and whatever armour the brothers of the watch use, is either stolen from free folks (it goes the other way around also) either inspired by them. After all, a seasoned brother of the night watch, is very similar to any one of the free folk, I guess the circumstances change a person.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I heavily relied in this answer on this excellent <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Concordance/Section/3.3./\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Several resources around the net (apologies for not having links handy) recommend to determine the total amount of available physical memory on a Linux system by the second value on the \"-/+ buffers/cache\" line in the output of <code>free</code>, with the explanation that buffers and cache may be discarded immediately if a process tries to allocate more memory than is unused at the time (\"Mem:\" line of <code>free</code>). I've found this statement to be consistently empirically wrong, meaning allocating more memory than is \"unused\" fails frequently.</p>\n\n<p>Researching about this, I've found the \"MemAvailable:\" line in <code>/proc/meminfo</code>, and <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/7/264\" rel=\"nofollow\">this explanation</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Subject: provide estimated available memory in /proc/meminfo\n\nMany load balancing and workload placing programs check /proc/meminfo\nto estimate how much free memory is available. They generally do this\nby adding up \"free\" and \"cached\", which was fine ten years ago, but\nis pretty much guaranteed to be wrong today.\n\nIt is wrong because Cached includes memory that is not freeable as\npage cache, for example shared memory segments, tmpfs, and ramfs,\nand it does not include reclaimable slab memory, which can take up\na large fraction of system memory on mostly idle systems with lots\nof files.\n\nCurrently, the amount of memory that is available for a new workload,\nwithout pushing the system into swap, can be estimated from MemFree,\nActive(file), Inactive(file), and SReclaimable, as well as the \"low\"\nwatermarks from /proc/zoneinfo.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that the system available for me to run my programs on has a 3.2.0 kernel which apparently does not provide \"MemAvailable\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> How can I (approximately) compute the amount of available physical memory myself, using that memory information that is available to me?</p>\n\n<pre><code>MemTotal:       16536344 kB\nMemFree:         8615224 kB\nBuffers:          241896 kB\nCached:          1341944 kB\nSwapCached:       100232 kB\nActive:          5320768 kB\nInactive:        2021312 kB\nActive(anon):    4298508 kB\nInactive(anon):  1483164 kB\nActive(file):    1022260 kB\nInactive(file):   538148 kB\nUnevictable:          32 kB\nMlocked:              32 kB\nSwapTotal:       9918460 kB\nSwapFree:        7730432 kB\nDirty:                56 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:       5720696 kB\nMapped:           103628 kB\nShmem:             23432 kB\nSlab:             432516 kB\nSReclaimable:     356780 kB\nSUnreclaim:        75736 kB\nKernelStack:        7320 kB\nPageTables:        69764 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    18186632 kB\nCommitted_AS:   12325296 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:      120924 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34351227352 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:         0 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:      103240 kB\nDirectMap2M:    16738304 kB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PS: I realize the actual computation is detailed in the kernel patch I linked to, but I'm having a hard time relating this to the output that is available to me.</p>",

		"Title" : "What is the best way to track the authenticated user on the server side?",
		"Body" : "<p>For a web app, the client side is javascript in the browser. The server side is ASP.NET with a REST API. At present there is a single server but we plan to scale out with a server each in the US, UK, and AUS (on Azure). We'll have redis (but that does not sync up instantaneously). They will (almost) always be using SSL.</p>\n\n<p>When a user logs in, we authenticate them. It's easy to pass back the primary key of that user record in the DB and on subsequent calls in, pass that PK to identify the user. It's also trivially easy to then impersonate any user.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way to implement this? The two things I have thought of are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Return a guid and require that guid on all subsequent calls.</li>\n<li>Store the PK in the Session data on the server side and use that to identify the user on all subsequent calls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both of the above work if an existing session continues to go to the same server (which I believe it does) for each subsequent request.</p>\n\n<p>So, what's the best way to do this? Either of the above two? Or is there another approach that's better?</p>\n\n<p>thanks - dave</p>",

It provides a character-user-interface, so it can be launched remotely, within a simple SSH connection (no web, no big GUI libraries, etc.);</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.ntop.org/products/ntop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NTOP</a>:  from the official website: \"<em>...a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does...</em>\". NTOP is way much feature-rich than IPTRAF. Definitely more powerful (but more complex to configure/install than a single \"<em>apt-get install</em>\" or \"<em>yum install</em>\")</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As clearly stated, both tools above provides good <strong>REAL-TIME</strong> data (as you asked in your question). Anyway, I'm quite confident that you need <em><strong>ALSO</strong></em> asynchronous data: I'm sure you want also to be able to check something like: \"<em>who were the hosts/MACs that generated/consumed most of the traffic, yesterday? And for which protocols?</em>\", probably drilling down such data back to a single IP/MAC/PORT, and down to a granularity of.... 1 minute. Don't you? In such a case I strongly reccomend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pmacct.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PMACCT</a>: from the official website: \"<em>...pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure, account, classify, aggregate and export IPv4 and IPv6 traffic..</em>\". Please note that PMACCT can solve a wide range of problems, most of them suited for big/large ISP/operators. Nevertheless, it can run perfectly of your linux-box and account for traffic flowing along its interfaces. With a configuration like this:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<pre><code>host:~# cat /etc/pmacct/pmacctd.conf\n\ninterface: eth0\ndaemonize: true\naggregate: src_mac,dst_mac,src_host,dst_host,proto,src_port,dst_port\n\nports_file: /etc/pmacct/ports.list \n\nplugins: mysql\n\nsql_user: pmacct\nsql_passwd: sqlpassword\nsql_db: pmacct\nsql_table: acct_v4_%Y_%m_%d\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it can easily keep track of traffic flowing along eth0 in a mysql table, so for you to easily check what happened on your network with a common/simple SQL-query.</p>\n\n<p>Just to give you some real numbers, I've succesfully used PMACCT on a server with a XEON X3350; 4GB of RAM; 4 broadcom GigaEth interfaces; nearly 70 VLANs configured on eth0 and pmacct listening on all of them; +/- 300GB of various IP traffic routed on a daily basis; PMACCT generating accounting EVERY_MINUTE, for EVERY_VLAN, for EVERY tuple (src_mac, dst_mac, src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, dst_port); +/- 60.000.000 accounting records per day. \nAll of this, without any issue (but writing on text-files, not in MySQL). In smaller environments, anyway, there are no problems in writing directly to MySQL.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please note that thanks to PMACCT I keep track of <em>EACH</em> IP addresses seen on my networks, on a daily basis (in other words: I know that 10.29.19.89 have not been seen since july 16th 2014; 172.17.1.45 have never been seen [since the start of PMACCT accounting]; etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Also on PMACCT: I have configured the ethernet switch connecting my main Internet-gateway, to \"mirror\" its traffic to a free port, where I've plugged an ad-hoc linux-box accounting all the Internet traffic (a 1GEth link). No issue at all.</p>\n\n<p>A final note about PMACCT: should you (or some other readers) wonder why I <strong>NOT</strong> choosed some more common NETFLOW/IPFIX probe/collector, the reason is very simple: PMACCT is the only one I've found being able to account also MAC-addresses.</p>",

Then, is a \"shemitah year\" the 7th year of a \"shemitah\" or is it\nthe 8th year - e.g. the first year AFTER a \"shemitah\"?  I thought a \"shemitah year\" is the 7th year- e.g. Sept./13 to Sept./14.

		"Title" : "Video continuously pausing when home streamed to iPhone with Bluetooth headphones",
		"Body" : "<p>I have my itunes library on home sharing to share my movie collection across my devices so I can watch either on my iPhone or apple tv. Streaming to my apple tv is perfect but streaming to my iPhone is buggy. I recently bought a new pair of blue tooth headphones to get rid the wires and they work great for listeing to music on home streaming but when I try stream movies from my pc to my iPhone using my headphones the video will play for +- 30 seconds, then pause and wait for what feels like minutes on end. Then it will play again for 30 seconds and pause. It seemed like a streaming issue but if I plug in the supplied cable for the headphones and don't use the bluetooth it streams fine for most movies. If it's a long movie(2.5hrs+) that is large file then even that will battle to stream to my iphone with bluetooth off. TV series episodes stream fine with no hesitation.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched the net for answers but nothing comes up relating specifically to my issue or anyway to solve it. I have reset modem, phone, pc logged in and out of home sharing, nothing seems to fix the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Putting the movies on my phone is also not an option because I don't have the space available even if I took all the apps and data off I would have enough space for maybe 1 or 2 movies. I only have a 16gb iPhone 5C</p>\n\n<p>All streaming is from windows 7 PC with iTunes 12. I have tried 2 different routers thinking that maybe the issue but also no luck</p>\n\n<p>I hope someone can come back with an answer</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2015-01-21</strong></p>\n\n<p>So after some more testing with different videos it seems the issue is a large bitrate file of 19000Kbps+ will not stream to my iphone if my bluetooth headphones are connected. The other videos I have now are all around 10000Kbps range and they work. I cannot confirm what is the max Kbps rate at which streaming and bluetooth headphones will not work but 19000kbps is too large.  </p>\n\n<p>Also My router doesn't have the ability to switch wifi to 5Ghz so I can't confirm if this would stop the \"interference\" between the headphones and wifi signal.</p>\n\n<p>I'll update in a few days with more findings after I do some more testing.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I have been running a LAMP stack on Debian for a couple of years for a medium sized .com.  A couple of advantages that I have found in Debian is the superb package manager, aptitude.  You can install and update the software via packages, which makes it less of a hassle to be running the latest, most secure version of the software.  Also, a huge advantage is that the stability of the Debian platform is nearly unmatched by even other flavors of linux, thanks to the Debian dev team's insistence on never releasing until the software is ready.  Finally, there is the great way in which they implemented apache2.  This seems trivial, but there are a2en a2dis utilities that allow for easily adding and removing modules and virtualhosts.<br>\nYou'll find most of these advantages in Ubuntu, but I've experienced issues in upgrading the OS to the next version that I don't run into when using Debian proper.</p>",

I want to add a custom module in the <code>modules</code>, but when doing so I encountered problems.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I cannot find anything like \"master configuration\" project type, which by default would contain the <code>manifests</code> and <code>modules</code> folders. So I created a bare \"Puppet project\" project, and created the folders manually. </p>\n\n<p>Because - as I understand it - in this configuration Gepetto doesn't really know, that this project will actually hold all the modules, it doesn't provide an option to create \"Puppet module project\" <strong>subproject</strong>, which would be nested inside the \"Puppet project\"'s <code>modules</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>When I nest it manually (by specifying a custom location in the <code>New Puppet Module Project</code> wizard), I get an <code>'Auto share git projects' has encountered a problem</code> error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unable to ignore resources\n  Attempted to beginRule: F/puppet@puppetmaster/modules/unnamed, does not match outer scope rule: MultiRule[P/mymodule]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did anyone of you managed to get Gepetto working with modules when everything is covered by something like \"master project\" that encapsulates all configuration? </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>As I am a non native speaker I appologize for the indulgence of giving my 2 cents and I warn that my grammatical understanding might be tinted by german synthax. But i think that I am able to help, or atleast point in the right direction. As it was already mentioned you would have to change \"has led\" to \"have led\" in your original quote if you would apply \"and\" instead of \"together with\" and i believe this to be the main issue here. Together with is no \"Linker\", it is a preposition which normally</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"My work ethic <em>and</em> belief in my ability <em>have</em> led to progress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is simply because \"and\" links 2 noun phrases together as the <em>subject</em> of your sentence. It is both, your work ethic AND your belief which led to progress. But still it would be more conventional to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"my work ethic(,) together with (my) belief in my ability(,) <em>has</em> led to progress.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, why is that? Quite simple; \"Together\" is an adverb. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We did this together. How have we done this? together</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, i am equal how not a big fan of \"together with\" as it seems awkward. but:\n\"together with\" is no linker. It is a preposition which normally introduces an adverbial phrase. It does not answer the question who is doing something but rather \"how\", \"through what\" or \"wherewith/whomwith\" something is done. As in \"YOU ran a marathon together with 1000 other athlets\". Using \"together with\" in your example would give your work ethics an outstanding role in coomparison to your self-belief, which would only have the sidekick. A perfect example to explain the difference of \"together with\" and \"and\" would be the following example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"the woman passes a man(,) together with some kids\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"the woman passes a man and some kids\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Atleast i would udnerstand these two sentences differently; in the first sentence it is not the man who is together with \"some kids\" but the women who passes him (though i am unsure about the requirement  of a comma). to clarify that the man is standing there with some kids you would have to say;</p>\n  \n  <p>\"the woman passes a man, <em>who is</em> together with some kids\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your believe in your ability becomes a tool rather then an actor should you use \"together with\". let's restructure your sentence to illustrate what this means: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Together with my/the belief in my ability, my work ethic has led to progress\"</p>\n  \n  <p>or more clumsy: </p>\n  \n  <p>\"My work ethic has led to progress, together with my believe in my ability\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at some more examples to clarify what i mean</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>He <em>is</em> playing (together) with his friends</p>\n    \n    <p>He and his friends <em>are</em> playing (alone in their homes) </p>\n    \n    <p>He and his friends are playing together</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the same goes for \"along with\".

		"Body" : "<p>If you are simply looking for an answer as to why your balance wasn't decreasing, the answer is that your logic was incorrect.</p>\n\n<pre><code>newBalance = (balance - minPay) + (balance * rate);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Should be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>newBalance = balance + (balance * rate) - minPay ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You want to add the interest to the current balance, and then subtract whatever the minimum payment is.

For example, you shouldn't instantiate a new instance of the class every loop. Instead, continue to use the same class instance. You should also check to see if the balance is 0, for example the output I got from running your program allowed me to pay into the negatives.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps, feel free to ask questions if it doesn't make sense.</p>",

While the above info is good to know, I've already spent a couple hours experimenting with my on-board equipment and settings (Windows 7, motherboard sound card) and I think at this point, the easiest and most foolproof solution for me is to buy an ASIO-supported sound card. I guess I didn't realize what a technical and niche area this is, since even searches I'm doing aren't turning back much info on a relatively low cost, ASIO supported card, which (I think) is all I need. Does anyone have some product recs? Am I way off base about all this? I come from the music side, not the computer side, and really my goal is to get up and running ASAP. Thanks</p>",

I found that in addition to the default.aspx for the app, there is also a built-in \"viewer.aspx\" which has no navigation bar at the top of the app. My workaround was to change the link to my Access App from the top-level site, so that it goes to the viewer.aspx instead of default.aspx. This way there is no direct link to the subsite, and no \"Back to Site\" link for people to click on and get confused. I also turned on the top-level site's Publishing so that I could make my links open in new tabs, so that my users don't have to click back a bunch of times to get back to the top-level site. For my situation, this was the best solution to the problem. I hope that this answer will help others who have a similar struggle where they need unique permissions (and therefore subsites), but also desire unique navigation.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\n~Sydney</p>",

As stated earlier, Sludge has trace amounts of metals in it, being that it comes from mining coal, and being that coal is under ground, where we find metal, it is possible to convert coal sludge in to gold. More difficult than just straight up metal, since you can never tell how much metal is in the sludge without a proper examination, which Ed never did. Again, this is all based on the manga, being that it was the original story and ultimate source if you can't consult the author. I hope this cleared it up at least a bit, thanks for reading.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I had this error, and now I have discovered the source of the problem. I had a hard time finding out, so maybe this will be useful to someone, even though I realize, my problem and workaround may not be spot on matching op's original trouble.</p>\n\n<p>I am migrating data from MSSQL to MySQL, and the content being migrated is html-content from Sitecore CMS (target CMS is Drupal, btw).</p>\n\n<p>I've found, that I get this error when converting the database and hitting records, that contain <strong>Instagram-embeds</strong>. Instagram-embeds work in the way, that the embedded post data is copied to the embed code (instead of being loaded async., et.c. - even the image is included as base64-css...), and the young people nowadays tend to put a lot of emoji's in their image-descriptions (using their iPhones with Emoji keyboard). Emoji's are represented by 4-byte encoded characters, but MySQL <code>utf8</code> only allows for 3-byte encoded unicode characters.</p>\n\n<p>My initial error from running <code>wbcopytables.exe</code> (which is the non-GUI way of doing Migration Wizard in MySQL Workbench) was the</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Error during charset conversion of wstring: No error</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but upgrading MySQL Workbench to recent version (from <em>5.something</em> to <em>6.x</em>) makes the error a bit more descriptive, hinting table and column (alas, not row):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ERROR: Could not successfully convert UCS-2 string to UTF-8 in table\n  [MyDatabase].[dbo].[MyTable] (column MyColumn).\n  Original string: ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway - a solution *could* be to use <code>utf8mb4</code> which would allow for the emoji's. Read more <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957238/incorrect-string-value-when-trying-to-insert-utf-8-into-mysql-via-jdbc\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But it looks like, it's <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1314214\" rel=\"nofollow\">a bad idea</a> to do this in e.g. my case with Drupal. </p>\n\n<p>So - the solution I ended up with was simply to strip these characters in my migrate-script. There is no point in keeping these for users of the site in question, since they are being displayed as rectangles on the webpage anyway. Script happens to be c# .NET, and I found the help <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28023682/how-do-i-remove-emoji-characters-from-a-string\">here</a> (thanks a ton, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet\">Jon Skeet</a>) - turns out there is a regex-pattern for matching one half of a surrogate pair in UTF-16. See below (and use the pattern in another language if needed).</p>\n\n<pre><code>var emojiStripped = Regex.Replace(stringWithEmojis, @\"\\p{Cs}\", string.Empty);\n</code></pre>",

BUT... nothing ever appears in the Inbox.   AND, it DOES succeed in loading the many sub-folders within the mail account that I have configured in yahoo... AND, if I click on one of those, then after 20 seconds, it loads the folder's contents fine. AND, when I SEND mail, it sends out just fine.  But nothing in the normal, plain Inbox!</p>\n\n<p>I have created it several times. Once I even tried to force it to allow me to \"manually\" create the inbox without it sniffing that it was a yahoo account and applying the official yahoo settings it knows. I did that by initially putting extra false characters in the yahoo domain name, and then setting up all the IMAP and SMTP stuff manually, and then changing the initial domain name entry to remove the wrong characters.  But the results were exactly the same -- empty inbox.</p>\n\n<p>AND, when I have yahoo set up in the normal way (but not working right...)  and I go to the Connection Doctor... it scans through and gives the green-light indicator saying that IMAP and SMTP are working fine!</p>\n\n<p>Any info, tips, or similar issues with Yahoo Mail and the mail.app in Yosemite?</p>\n\n<p>THANKS -- Eric</p>",

OK oh shit here are these terrible gnome VNC grey screens again .. digging digging through Gnome forums (other vnc servers run happily Linux Mint) then I noted I need to set Vino params over SSH - got \"Cannot autolaunch D-Bus without X11 $DISPLAY\" (I DONT HAVE A DESKTOP!!!), tried the DBUS shell script - that of course doesnt work, then found out (while vnc is already running and I have a 'Display') , I can issue:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DISPLAY=:1 gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>yes that executes without an error\n(display number is your vnc desktop number)\nbut still that shit grey screen in the vnc terminal...</p>\n\n<p>So again, January 2015, the setting of variables through SSH so that a VNC client will efficiently work on GNOME is still a disaster and the advice stands firm to leave GNOME and install XFCE as above. Not as nice, but ... it works. And installs in a minute instead of spending days to find those (no doubt they will exist) few simple commands that will fix the gnome problem.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Trying to answer you question I decided to create HOWTO from the very beginning what I did to get my Drool rules executed on remote server. </p>\n\n<p>My task was to integrate Kie Workbench and Execution Server, so business users be able to create Drools rules and deploy them to the Repo, while developers could use these rules via calling REST services of standalone Drools execution server. </p>\n\n<p>You should follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before using Drools Execution Server let me use such terminology:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kie Drools Workbench - is UI for creating and deploying Model and\nRules file(s) to Maven Repository</li>\n<li>Kie Execution Server - is standalone Drools execution server. It consumes REST calls of commands and returns execution results</li>\n<li>Assumed you have Tomcat 7.0/8.0 and Maven installed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Deployment of Drools Workbench</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most stable version of  Kie Drools Workbench to deploy at the moment is  6.1.0.Final. Use this one for deploying on Tomcat 7.0 only!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You can download file called kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars from <a href=\"https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav~~kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars~~~\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jboss sonar repo</a>, use version 6.1.0.Final and <strong>tomcat7.war</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure you added following jars to Tomcat's lib directory: <strong>javax.security.jacc-api-1.4.jar, kie-tomcat-integration.jar, slf4j-api-1.7.2.jar</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure you have or added following roles/users to tomcat-users.xml of your Tomcat:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code><role rolename=\"admin\"/> <!-- Tomcat Admin role -->\n<role rolename=\"analyst\"/> <!-- Kie Workbench Analyst role. -->\n<role rolename=\"kie-server\"/> <!-- Kie Drools Execution Server role.

Use admin credentials configured in previous step to enter Workbench. In our case <strong>user1/user1</strong></li>\n<li><p>In Kie Workbench create a Model, Rules file. Validate them and click Deploy. Make sure you have jar file with your project being put to Maven repo!</p>\n\n<p>As an example you can use rule and model I created for testing purposes:\nDrool rule file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import com.arty.drlwb.MyExampleType;\n\nrule \"one\"\nwhen \nMyExampleType(message == \"Hello Worlddddd\")\nthen\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World:)\");\nend\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Deployment of Kie Drools Execution Server</strong> </p>\n\n<p>For the moment of this To-Do writing the most stable version of Kie Drools Execution Server is <strong>kie-server-services-6.2.0.Beta3.war</strong>.

I have strung together two images as an animation in Photoshop, both high quality off the bat (2000 x 3000 px), I know when I compress into a moving GIF it's going to be slightly lower quality, which is fine as the intended output is 300 x 500 px. My issue is with the blockiness of the background. The images are shot on a grey studio backdrop, and whilst the subject is not blocky in any way, the background becomes heavily pixelated and colour is distorted. I know what I'm doing with settings, dithers and colours etc, so my question is:</p>\n\n<p>Is there are better methodology to creating a high quality GIF without the above issue?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>If you transmit a sequence of bits over some line, errors may creep in. For instance, if the Bit Error Rate of this line is 1%, on average, every 1 out of 100 bits will flip to the opposite value.</p>\n\n<p>For a single transmitted bit, this relates to a Bernoulli trial with $p=0.99$ for being a 'success' and $q=1-p=0.01$ for a failure.</p>\n\n<p>If this same bit is transmitted over two identical lines, there are two pathways of getting a correct result: two correct transmissions or two wrong transmissions (flipping the bit twice). The probability, therefore, is $p*p+q*q$.</p>\n\n<p>Following this sequence for multiple transmissions, we get:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{r\u00A6c\u00A6c}\n\\textbf{ }&\\textbf{correct}&\\textbf{wrong}\\\\\n\\textbf{1}&p&q\\\\\n\\textbf{2}&p^{2}+q^{2}&2pq\\\\\n\\textbf{3}&p^{3}+3pq^{2}&3p^{2}q+3pq^{2}\\\\\n\\textbf{4}&p^{4}+6p^{2}q^{2}+q^{4}&4p^{3}q+4pq^{3}\n\\end{array}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>The parameters in front of each term seem to relate to Pascal's triangle. Furthemore, the 'correct' descriptions seem to be 'symmetric', while the 'wrong' ones are 'anti-symmetric'. Can somebody explain the connection, and is there perhaps a general function which describes this series?</p>\n\n<p>My real question is the following: what if the bits are transmitted across different lines $i$ each with a different BER $p_i$. The table then becomes:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{r\u00A6c\u00A6c}\n\\textbf{ }&\\textbf{correct}&\\textbf{wrong}\\\\\n\\textbf{1}&p_{1}&1-p_{1}\\\\\n\\textbf{2}&2p_{1}p_{2}-p_{1}-p_{2}+1&p_{1}-2p_{1}p_{2}+p_{2}\\\\\n\\textbf{3}&4p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}-2p_{1}p_{2}-2p_{2}p_{3}-2p_{3}p_{1}+p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}&etc.\n\\end{array}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>Is there a general function which describes this behaviour? Can someone explain anything more about this series? Does this have a name?</p>",

(PS. I realise that Amazon is the one not charging this fee.)</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the usual cost to transfer a .rentals domain would be about $30. Can the registrar just charge arbitrary amounts on each domain?</p>\n\n<p>I'm keeping ownership of the domain. It's not a sale.. I just want to move it to another registrar.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone ever experienced something like this before? Do I have any options available to me? (ICANN complain etc?) When it was registered I wasn't told it was PREMIUM? </p>",

I noticed that when i tried to re-sync the songs to check they weren't corrupt an error came up on the windows phone app thing saying 'something happened we didn't expect error 80004005'.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyway to fix this? (its a micro sd)</p>\n\n<p>Also when i tried to delete the working artist from my phone it asked if i wanted to delete but then 'copying' came up at the top, what is the phone trying to do?</p>",

		"Title" : "The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something enti...",
		"Body" : "<p>The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something entirely new without actually destroying the game balance. It says one of the easier ways of \"making a new class\" is to change the spell list. In that way, the power level of the class isn't altered but it does feel different (it exemplifies the use of a Paladin to make a guardian, using arcane magic to protect a powerful sorcerer instead of divine magic to keep his Oath).</p>\n\n<p>So, here is my suggestion of how you're supposed to do it:</p>\n\n<h2>First Suggestion: Changing the traits of a Wizard and turning it into a Invoker:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use the wizard as baseline.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your DM finds it's necessary, change the spellcasting ability to WIS as it was in D&D4e. What you will need to do is to take the Wizard Spell List and change it to make it feel the closest you can get to your old Invoker. Get every destructive spell that reminds you of your encounter and daily powers and eliminate things your invoker certainly wouldn't do (as raising undead).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Intuitive Magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>Change the trait of spells know. The Invoker is sort of a divine sorcerer. Therefore, it should feel that much as a wizard. I believe this class shouldn't be able to prepare spells and have potentially ilimited number of spells known, but it should work just like the sorcerer, having a number of spells to use according to the sorcerer's spell-list. You'll be sacrificing all the wizard's malleability for one extra cantrip and certainty that you'll always get new spells when you level up.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Change the spell foci</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just do it the same way it was with your Invoker Implements. Wizards use wands and crystal balls (I believe), you invoker though, will go for Rods and Staffs only, just like in 4e.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Choose the school of magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a DM, I'd limit it into something that would make it feel like you're using divine intuitive magic. Abjuration, evocation and divination are the ones I'd recommend for that matter.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ritual caster feature</strong></p>\n\n<p>Invokers are supposed to be ritual casters. You already lost you ability to prepare magic. I'd rule that you'd start with one ritual known and everytime you learn new spells, you get to choose a new ritual. You still know less spells than the wizard that way and you get to keep a cool feature.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure those changes won't affect the power of your class and it's all made according to the DMG suggestions of how to change a class. If you change a few features and keep all the rest as suggested, it won't feel as a wizard nor as a sorcerer. Specially with your unique spell list.</p>\n\n<p>If you dislike it, there's a second simpler option that I dislike but it can work for you. </p>\n\n<h2>Reskin the sorcerer.</h2>\n\n<p>This is quite simple. Just change the description of your character. Sorcerers have great mechanics now that makes them feel like intuitive spell casters (sorcery points).</p>\n\n<p>And if you choose draconic magic, you can always say it's not draconic at all. If you get your dragon wings, you can describe it as angelical wings or wings of light. In the end it's a game about imagining it all anyways.</p>\n\n<p>I hope it was helpful.</p>",

Having heard nothing of the rest of the song yet, I initally took it musically. It is a common thing for people to say they are \"all about that bass\", to where the phrase is almost like a sample, except there's no actual recording where someone said it that everybody knows and uses. So, I thought nothing much more about it than just the appreciation of a familiar sample used well. Until she's like \"no treble\". People dont really say they're not about treble,  just that they're all about bass. I initally took it as her just saying that in an extension of being all about bass, while attempting to be witty/cute. To myself, I thought,  \"no treble? That's stupid and makes no sense if you think bout it, since there's not much bass in the song really anyways\"\nOnce I heard the rest of the song, I realized that she probably meant her butt, but then \"no treble\" made absolutely no sense. I never even thought about breasts or the upper body, I was just like, \"what the heck is she talking about; treble?\"\nI started to feel like she was just simply guilty of just saying \"no treble\" because of how shes all about bass and treble is erroneously thought of as being the counter or opposite to bass,( like how capitalism is errobeously considered the opposite, or counter, of socialism),  and that pissed me off a bit to where I'm thinking \"whats wrong with treble? Im all about bass, but treble has its place.\" Hahaha.\nUpon deeper and more thourough analysis, I have come to the conclusion that she perhaps thought of it originally as a knee-jerk response to saying she's \"all about that bass\" (while writing the song i mean. FYI, her and some other guy wrote this song together somewhat quickly, starting from something she had previously wrote or some idea she had had. Yes, i actually spent time researching this...) She might have been thinking of bass in terms of meaning booty at first, but once she said \"no treble\" and liked it, bass as booty leaves the meaning of treble somewhat unclear. So, whether that is how it happened or not, I believe she has decided that bass and treble refer to large and skinny body sizes, respectively. When she says she is \"all about that bass; no treble\" she is referring to herself and speaking as if to a potential \"love interest\" and saying something like, \"I'm a big girl; you ain't gonna find no skinny bitches here.\"</p>\n\n<p>The song plays around with \"hating\" on skinny chicks, calling them bitches then saying she was just kidding, then starting to talk \"shit\" by starting with \"I know you think you're fat\" and even though she just did it,  you don't think she's joking again and dont expect her reassurances of how it is a given that \"every inch of u is perfect\"</p>\n\n<p>But yeah. She means bass to mean big, large, etc and treble to mean thin, skinny, etc. But she also thinks of it as referring to booty, specifically a substantial booty. In this regard, she is not thinking of a treblethat  refers to the body part which is the counter or opposite of a butt, whatever that would be. </p>",

The phone streams music in Win7 with a different system.\nI have tried some suggestions from old threads in this community and other pages but they have slightly different approaches and I always reach a dead end, probably because of n00bness...\nPhone pairs right off a clean Ubuntu 14.04 installation but just for file transfer and Blueman cannot configure it as Audio Source, it says \"connection failed: Stream setup failed\" ???  I have also installed Bluez and PulseAudio.\n\"Enable=Source\" was added at the end of /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf but still PulseAudio does not recognize phone as audio source.\nThis is all mixed up for me because of the different programs and I still do not have a clear picture of which does what. I hope any one here helps me with step by step instructions.\nThanks!!!</p>",

I don't have enough reputation points to add a comment to your answer, so I'll just edit my entry.</p>\n\n<p>The hack was required in addition to the function change suggested by the developer log to make the add-on fully functional.</p>\n\n<p>Updating the function name as you suggested does allow the fieldtype to install successfully, but it still doesn't work right. The fieldtype loads in the entry, but when you put in any address information and hit \"Geocode Entry\" it yields no results. That's why it was suggested to hack the fieldtype code. Like you, I do not recommend a system hack ever, so I am trying to find the portion of the add-on that EE 2.7+ does not like.</p>\n\n<p>I've never built an add-on, so I am at a loss for where to go from here.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>There are <strong>TWO Settings</strong> that are independent of each other: <strong>Auto-Correct</strong> and <strong>Spell-Check</strong>.  \"Auto-Correct\" can inadvertently change what you intended to write, while \"Spell-Check\" just independently and automatically marks misspellings.</p>\n\n<p>To change <strong>AUTO-CORRECT:</strong><br>\n-- Go to <strong>Settings...  Preferences...</strong><br>\n-- Then, on the left pane, under the \"Backup\" section, go to \n<strong>\"AUTO-COMPLETION\" section:</strong><br>\n-- Simply <strong>UN-check</strong> this choice.  (No NPP++ restart required)<br>\nThis does not turn off spell checking, so you will still see misspelled words marked with a red underline.  </p>\n\n<p>To change <strong>SPELL-CHECK:</strong><br>\nSimply toggle the <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eke1H.jpg\" alt=\"Button with ABC and a ~~~ as an underline, on the toolbar\">, (or the DS button in older versions.) <strong>NOTE: This will NOT change the \"Auto-Completion\" setting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, you are not alone.... This \"Auto-Correct\" problem really \"bugged\" me until today.</p>\n\n<p>In the January 2015 version 6.7.4, by default, \"Spell-Checking\" now does a lot more than just \"check\" spelling.   Auto-Correct has been driving me mad, occasionally fixing my \"spelling\" for things like precise links that now no longer work, which I didn't notice were changed, until they failed.  </p>\n\n<p>NP++ Devs:  Thanks for all your work, but I'd suggest putting an on/off on the toolbar for both Auto-Correct and Spell-Check, and I'd suggest that you turn Auto-Check off by default.  Also, in preferences, call it \"spell-checking\" so we can find it, and allow me to change both settings under one place.  If that means that there are two places in the UI or prefs, then allow me to change both settings, both places, where it is obvious there are two separate settings.  </p>",

He is opening a bicycle store in New York and plans to name it Cycle Fitness. Your firm is to design a new logo for this new shop and as well as for future locations he plans to open. Cycle Fitness plans to hold free seminars on bike safety, cycling for fitness, what to look for when buying a bicycle, choosing the right bike, choosing a bike for a child, and creating a cycle group that will be doing monthly cycle trips. Your firm must design the new logo, a grand opening postcard for mailing, a business card, a rack card that will sit on the counter in a holder indicating all the seminars offered, and a quarter page advertisement, and a tee shirt. The shop\u2019s address is 123 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 20013. Grand opening is June 1. </p>\n\n<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tp48P.png\" alt=\"Cycle Fitness Logo\"></p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I recently came across the following problem on a set of past examination papers for a university module I'm currently taking:</p>\n\n<p>'A video manufacturer produces 8500 video recorders on a continuous \nproduction line every month. Each video requires a tape head unit and these \nare produced very quickly in batches. It costs \u20AC13,000 to set up the machinery \nto produce a batch and \u20AC0.30 a month to store and insure a tape head once \nmade. How large should the batch size be to minimize total costs and how \noften will they have to set up a production run?'</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at the following values:\n - r = 8500\n - K = 13000\n - h = 0.30</p>\n\n<p>While trying to apply the formula to find the optimal batch size for a continuous EOQ model, that is q* = {2KDr/(h(r-D))}^1/2 , I noticed that only the rate of production per month was given, not the Demand of the product. Is there some way to calculate this problem to get around this roadblock or am I approaching the problem incorrectly?</p>\n\n<p>I've tried applying the regular EOQ formula, that is q* = (2KD/h)^1/2 , where Demand is the 8500 value, but I ended up with a seemingly unusual value (which may be completely correct given my lack of experience in this field) : I received an answer close to 27,142 and using q/D to find the time gap between orders I arrived upon roughly 0.3 orders per month.</p>\n\n<p>I came here to ask two things: Is there a way to solve the former continuous model question? Or is the latter question using the basic EOQ model formula closer to being correct?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance, this has been bothering me for the past two days. </p>",

B&H has been successfully sued several times for discriminating against non-Jewish employees,including for paying them less than Jewish employees, and blocking them from management positions.  In the article, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who is an Orthodox rabbi and an author of several Jewish business books is quoted in the article as saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lapin maintains that none of the aforementioned allegations undermine B&H\u2019s integrity. \u201CWhere in the Torah does it say that you have to pay all employees the same rate? Where in the Torah is equality depicted as a virtue? The answer is nowhere at all.\u201D The company\u2019s business model, according to Lapin, adheres to God\u2019s plan insofar as it\u2019s described in, \u201CHis book.\u201D</p>\n  \n  <p>\u201CThe notion that there\u2019s a moral flaw in people who, because they don\u2019t pay all their employees the same \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I see the basis for that in morality. It may not be fair, it may not be legal, those are not my areas. But to say that there is a clash with Jewish values simply would not be true,\u201D said Lapin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is Lapin's view correct? <strong>Excluding dina d'malchuta issues</strong>, is it correct that there is no moral problem in Judaism with discrimination?

		"Title" : "Memory leak problem using Irrlicht engine",
		"Body" : "<p>I am using Irrlicht 1.8.1 as part of my game project. Recently I have been struggling with the fullscreen toggling problem, once Irrlicht does not have a default way to alternate fullscreen/unfullscreen at run-time. You have to set this option at the start. This way I had to rewrote the code to make all the engine restart at F11's pressing, the button to toggle, saving all the previous states to make the transition hidden to the player.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, something went wrong and at some time it was made clear that memory leak appeared somewhere during the reset transition. Every time F11 is pressed you can see on Windows Task Bar that the memory used by the software increases mysteriously. I wrote a loop to continuously fullscreen/unfullscreen and left it for some minutes. The needed memory on Task Bar increased from 20k to 30k in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I reviewed all my code multiple times trying to find out what might be wrong. The search pointed me up to a specific point in my code, exactly where the Irrlicht device is to be restarted. To test it I made the following:</p>\n\n<p>I removed this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Finish the old device\ndevice->closeDevice();\ndevice->drop();\n\n// Create new device\ndevice = createDeviceEx( params );\n\n// Return new device\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Return old device without finishing it\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The software simply stopped growing up every time it goes fullscreen or unfullscreen. Obviously the fullscreen/unfullsreen stopped working. I know Windows Task Bar is a very crude way to test memory leaks, but the problem is clear. Anyway, I am still learning. I do not know if I am closing the device and replacing it the right way and that is why I may be still leaving some garbage on memory.</p>\n\n<p>I would like some guide here.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Recently, my BEHA induction oven (Type: C632.745DHSrvW, Model: D 644 KI) stopped working. When I turn the induction panel on, instead of showing 0 on all plates, it is now flashing F-5-F-5 on all plates. Sometimes when I turn it on, it works just fine again, but most of the time it's showing the F-5 error code. </p>\n\n<p>I talked to support, and they told me it was most likely something wrong with one of the two chips inside of the oven, and that I could buy one from them and replace it myself. The chip cost 200 USD...... So I got it, replaced the old one, and still have the same problem. I called them back, and they said they take no returns from private customers, so now I'm out 200 bucks on nothing. They also said that this most likely means there's something wrong with the other chip, which is 400 bucks. Still no guarantee that it's going to work. </p>\n\n<p>Since it's sometimes working and sometimes not, it seems weird to me that it's necessary to replace one of these chips - a bad connection seems more likely. Do any of you know any other solutions i could try? Here is an image of the chip I bought: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3</a></p>",

But then\nthe sentences 2.a and 2.b should be analyzed in the same way, which\nimplies that 2.a is an ergative use of the verb <em>float</em>. But then,\nsentence 2.c should also be ergative. Is that the case?</p>\n\n<p>And then, in successive variations, what of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The man stood near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The dog walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked his dog near his boat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>About question 1</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>'s answer is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In linguistics, an ergative verb is a verb that can be either\n    transitive or intransitive, and whose subject when intransitive\n    corresponds to its direct object when transitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be illustrated by the question examples. But if you look\nat the second example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He fired a gun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can also say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun fired a bullet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and that is transitive.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the verb <em>shoot</em> is used.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He shot the gun</p>\n  \n  <p>He shot a man</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a bullet</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a man</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though I am not sure one would say intransitively</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun shot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it all seems a bit more complicated that the simple rule of\nWikipedia and your first question,</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I often find formulas of minerals where some element symbols are grouped within square brackets and separated by a vertical bar. An example can be brochantite, whose formula I find expressed as Cu$_4$[(OH)$_6$|SO$_4$].</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what does such a notation means, and I have made some conjectures, although I find no reference on line or in books. I suppose that the square brackets are used to enclose the set of the anions present in the compound and the vertical bar is used to separates different anions, while the cations remain outside the square brackets. That is just an intuitive supposition. Is my supposition correct? If it is not, what does the described notation mean? I heartily thank you for any answer!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Say someone calls a web service on a server, the relevant data is being retrieved in batches and the message is being streamed to the client. In the middle of the message some kind of exception is encountered. My current implementation sort of just stops streaming the (in this case soap) message and starts building an error message, but obviously the result won't be a valid message or even valid XML.</p>\n\n<p>I considered a few options, none of them seem to make much sense:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Put all the relevant data in memory and then only stream the message itself.</li>\n<li>Do a double-take, so see if it works out with a fake stream and then do the real stream.</li>\n<li>Stream to a disk first and then use a file input stream to stream to the client</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see all have serious downsides in terms of memory/disk consumption, speed/resource efficiency or even validity of the data. How would I best implement error handling in this situation? Do I just have to pick the least worst of these options? If so I tend to favor to the current situation where the message is just invalid in cases like these, because it at least doesn't affect the base case where everything is fine.</p>",

		"Title" : "Blender Texture Bake Problems",
		"Body" : "<p>Hopefully someone can help. I tried to ask this in the question section, but I am not permitted to start new topics yet. This is partially a Unity question and partially a Blender question. I will be asking in both places. Thank you all in advance for any help.</p>\n\n<p>I'm new to CG and have been self educating for the past few months. I have progressed fairly well, but I can't seem to get exactly what I want with my objects when they are displayed in Unity. I would like them to appear as they do in Blender when they are rendered, but I can't seem to duplicate the effects in Unity.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue I have seems to somehow relate to scaling the texture prior to baking. Objects that do not require scaling prior to the bake to get the texture to display properly (e.g...Rocks) import to Unity perfectly, but Objects that require scaling (e.g....BlockWalls) to get the texture to display correctly go haywire when they are baked (Rock and Ruins were both baked the same way, only difference was the scaling, which I used a Texture Coordinate [UV] and Mapping Vector in Blender to position and scale). The textures show as a black field interspersed with small images of the textured UV unwrapped faces at various intervals on the surface of the object when applied in unity. I believe this is some type of issue with the interplay of light baking to the surface and scaling. </p>\n\n<p>I am able to get the textures into Unity just fine without baking and just save the image files and the .blend directly into Unity, but that's where the texture quality loss is happening. I have also tried various other modifications within Unity to attempt to restore some of the quality lost (e.g.... Bump/Diffuse. Parallax Diffuse, Self Illuminated Bump Diffuse/Parallax Diffuse etc... I do have proper Normal Maps and Parallax Maps, made via Crazy Bump and Gimp).</p>\n\n<p>Also, when I am baking the texture image in Blender, I am in Cycles Render - Object and Image are selected. </p>\n\n<p>I am including screenshots for examples. Any help would be immensely appreciated. <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9NsAn.jpg\" alt=\"Unbaked Texture in Blender\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IVsnA.jpg\" alt=\"Baked Texture in Unity3D\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykF5j.jpg\" alt=\"Rock Texture Baked in Unity3D, Same method, no scaling\"></p>",
