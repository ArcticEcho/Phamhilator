    "Body": "<p>I am creating a Program using PyQt and SQL which a user is presented with two tables. One shows a table of products, the other shows the products in the current order. The Product Table and Order Table are  SQL Tables created in a .db file.At the moment, The Product Table is populated and the Order Table is not. Currently the User can select an entire row in the Product Table and when the user clicks a button, I want the row in which the user selected to be put into the Order Table. I need help in getting the values inside the row selected (This is easily done using a <code>QTableWidget</code>but im not sure how to do it using a <code>QSqlTabelModel</code> inside a <code>QTableView</code>. Here is an example of the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.main_layout = QVBoxLayout()\n\nself.ProductTable = QTableView()\n\nself.OrderTable = QTableView()\n\nself.model = QSqlTableModel()\n\nself.AddButton = QPushButton(\"Add Product To Order\")\nself.AddButton.clicked.connect(self.add_product_to_order)\n\nself.model.setTable(\"Product\")\nself.model.select()\nself.ProductTable.setmodel(self.model)\n\nself.model.setTable(\"Order\")\nself.model.select()`\nself.OrderTable.setModel(self.model)\n\nself.main_layout.addWidget(self.ProductTable)\nself.main_layout.addWidget(self.AddButton)\nself.main_layout.addWidget(self.OrderTable)\n\ndef add_product_to_order(self):\n    pass\n</code></pre>",

    "Body": "<p>I have a gizduino(arduino clone) used on my project. I use an adaptor that is rated 9V 2A as my source going directly to the Vin pin and GND. I have tested my circuit on the few last weeks without problem and testing if I can receive serial message from the device which needs both Vin and USB port working and it also works without problem. But when I have tested it today, the Vin pin wont work and wont power my board. But when I use USB, it is powering. I think something shorted my Vin pin and GND while I am plugging it. Below is the schematic provided by the seller of the board. Can i do something to revive my board and use the Vin pin again? </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QK38s.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\">\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TrRs3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>",

    "Title": "The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something enti...",
    "Body": "<p>The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something entirely new without actually destroying the game balance. It says one of the easier ways of \"making a new class\" is to change the spell list. In that way, the power level of the class isn't altered but it does feel different (it exemplifies the use of a Paladin to make a guardian, using arcane magic to protect a powerful sorcerer instead of divine magic to keep his Oath).</p>\n\n<p>So, here is my suggestion of how you're supposed to do it:</p>\n\n<h2>First Suggestion: Changing the traits of a Wizard and turning it into a Invoker:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use the wizard as baseline.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your DM finds it's necessary, change the spellcasting ability to WIS as it was in D&D4e. What you will need to do is to take the Wizard Spell List and change it to make it feel the closest you can get to your old Invoker. Get every destructive spell that reminds you of your encounter and daily powers and eliminate things your invoker certainly wouldn't do (as raising undead).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Intuitive Magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>Change the trait of spells know. The Invoker is sort of a divine sorcerer. Therefore, it should feel that much as a wizard. I believe this class shouldn't be able to prepare spells and have potentially ilimited number of spells known, but it should work just like the sorcerer, having a number of spells to use according to the sorcerer's spell-list. You'll be sacrificing all the wizard's malleability for one extra cantrip and certainty that you'll always get new spells when you level up.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Change the spell foci</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just do it the same way it was with your Invoker Implements. Wizards use wands and crystal balls (I believe), you invoker though, will go for Rods and Staffs only, just like in 4e.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Choose the school of magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a DM, I'd limit it into something that would make it feel like you're using divine intuitive magic. Abjuration, evocation and divination are the ones I'd recommend for that matter.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ritual caster feature</strong></p>\n\n<p>Invokers are supposed to be ritual casters. You already lost you ability to prepare magic. I'd rule that you'd start with one ritual known and everytime you learn new spells, you get to choose a new ritual. You still know less spells than the wizard that way and you get to keep a cool feature.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure those changes won't affect the power of your class and it's all made according to the DMG suggestions of how to change a class. If you change a few features and keep all the rest as suggested, it won't feel as a wizard nor as a sorcerer. Specially with your unique spell list.</p>\n\n<p>If you dislike it, there's a second simpler option that I dislike but it can work for you. </p>\n\n<h2>Reskin the sorcerer.</h2>\n\n<p>This is quite simple. Just change the description of your character. Sorcerers have great mechanics now that makes them feel like intuitive spell casters (sorcery points).</p>\n\n<p>And if you choose draconic magic, you can always say it's not draconic at all. If you get your dragon wings, you can describe it as angelical wings or wings of light. In the end it's a game about imagining it all anyways.</p>\n\n<p>I hope it was helpful.</p>",

    "Body": "<p>I don't really even know if I should wrote this as an answer,  but it's something I've actually thought about before reading your question so I had to take the opportunity to say it since it's likely the only time I'll run across people getting deep about this (admittedly not-so-deep) song. </p>\n\n<p>WWhen I first heard the song, it of course opened with her saying the phrase in question. Having heard nothing of the rest of the song yet, I initally took it musically. It is a common thing for people to say they are \"all about that bass\", to where the phrase is almost like a sample, except there's no actual recording where someone said it that everybody knows and uses. So, I thought nothing much more about it than just the appreciation of a familiar sample used well. Until she's like \"no treble\". People dont really say they're not about treble,  just that they're all about bass. I initally took it as her just saying that in an extension of being all about bass, while attempting to be witty/cute. To myself, I thought,  \"no treble? That's stupid and makes no sense if you think bout it, since there's not much bass in the song really anyways\"\nOnce I heard the rest of the song, I realized that she probably meant her butt, but then \"no treble\" made absolutely no sense. I never even thought about breasts or the upper body, I was just like, \"what the heck is she talking about; treble?\"\nI started to feel like she was just simply guilty of just saying \"no treble\" because of how shes all about bass and treble is erroneously thought of as being the counter or opposite to bass,( like how capitalism is errobeously considered the opposite, or counter, of socialism),  and that pissed me off a bit to where I'm thinking \"whats wrong with treble? Im all about bass, but treble has its place.\" Hahaha.\nUpon deeper and more thourough analysis, I have come to the conclusion that she perhaps thought of it originally as a knee-jerk response to saying she's \"all about that bass\" (while writing the song i mean. FYI, her and some other guy wrote this song together somewhat quickly, starting from something she had previously wrote or some idea she had had. Yes, i actually spent time researching this...) She might have been thinking of bass in terms of meaning booty at first, but once she said \"no treble\" and liked it, bass as booty leaves the meaning of treble somewhat unclear. So, whether that is how it happened or not, I believe she has decided that bass and treble refer to large and skinny body sizes, respectively. When she says she is \"all about that bass; no treble\" she is referring to herself and speaking as if to a potential \"love interest\" and saying something like, \"I'm a big girl; you ain't gonna find no skinny bitches here.\"</p>\n\n<p>The song plays around with \"hating\" on skinny chicks, calling them bitches then saying she was just kidding, then starting to talk \"shit\" by starting with \"I know you think you're fat\" and even though she just did it,  you don't think she's joking again and dont expect her reassurances of how it is a given that \"every inch of u is perfect\"</p>\n\n<p>But yeah. She means bass to mean big, large, etc and treble to mean thin, skinny, etc. But she also thinks of it as referring to booty, specifically a substantial booty. In this regard, she is not thinking of a treblethat  refers to the body part which is the counter or opposite of a butt, whatever that would be. </p>",

The phone streams music in Win7 with a different system.\nI have tried some suggestions from old threads in this community and other pages but they have slightly different approaches and I always reach a dead end, probably because of n00bness...\nPhone pairs right off a clean Ubuntu 14.04 installation but just for file transfer and Blueman cannot configure it as Audio Source, it says \"connection failed: Stream setup failed\" ???  I have also installed Bluez and PulseAudio.\n\"Enable=Source\" was added at the end of /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf but still PulseAudio does not recognize phone as audio source.\nThis is all mixed up for me because of the different programs and I still do not have a clear picture of which does what. I hope any one here helps me with step by step instructions.\nThanks!!!</p>",

I don't have enough reputation points to add a comment to your answer, so I'll just edit my entry.</p>\n\n<p>The hack was required in addition to the function change suggested by the developer log to make the add-on fully functional.</p>\n\n<p>Updating the function name as you suggested does allow the fieldtype to install successfully, but it still doesn't work right. The fieldtype loads in the entry, but when you put in any address information and hit \"Geocode Entry\" it yields no results. That's why it was suggested to hack the fieldtype code. Like you, I do not recommend a system hack ever, so I am trying to find the portion of the add-on that EE 2.7+ does not like.</p>\n\n<p>I've never built an add-on, so I am at a loss for where to go from here.</p>",

This \"Auto-Correct\" problem really \"bugged\" me until today.</p>\n\n<p>In the January 2015 version 6.7.4, by default, \"Spell-Checking\" now does a lot more than just \"check\" spelling.   Auto-Correct has been driving me mad, occasionally fixing my \"spelling\" for things like precise links that now no longer work, which I didn't notice were changed, until they failed.  </p>\n\n<p>NP++ Devs:  Thanks for all your work, but I'd suggest putting an on/off on the toolbar for both Auto-Correct and Spell-Check, and I'd suggest that you turn Auto-Check off by default.  Also, in preferences, call it \"spell-checking\" so we can find it, and allow me to change both settings under one place.  If that means that there are two places in the UI or prefs, then allow me to change both settings, both places, where it is obvious there are two separate settings.  </p>",

Cycle Fitness plans to hold free seminars on bike safety, cycling for fitness, what to look for when buying a bicycle, choosing the right bike, choosing a bike for a child, and creating a cycle group that will be doing monthly cycle trips. Your firm must design the new logo, a grand opening postcard for mailing, a business card, a rack card that will sit on the counter in a holder indicating all the seminars offered, and a quarter page advertisement, and a tee shirt. The shop’s address is 123 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 20013.

    "Body": "<p>I recently came across the following problem on a set of past examination papers for a university module I'm currently taking:</p>\n\n<p>'A video manufacturer produces 8500 video recorders on a continuous \nproduction line every month. Each video requires a tape head unit and these \nare produced very quickly in batches. It costs €13,000 to set up the machinery \nto produce a batch and €0.30 a month to store and insure a tape head once \nmade. How large should the batch size be to minimize total costs and how \noften will they have to set up a production run?'</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at the following values:\n - r = 8500\n - K = 13000\n - h = 0.30</p>\n\n<p>While trying to apply the formula to find the optimal batch size for a continuous EOQ model, that is q* = {2KDr/(h(r-D))}^1/2 , I noticed that only the rate of production per month was given, not the Demand of the product. Is there some way to calculate this problem to get around this roadblock or am I approaching the problem incorrectly?</p>\n\n<p>I've tried applying the regular EOQ formula, that is q* = (2KD/h)^1/2 , where Demand is the 8500 value, but I ended up with a seemingly unusual value (which may be completely correct given my lack of experience in this field) : I received an answer close to 27,142 and using q/D to find the time gap between orders I arrived upon roughly 0.3 orders per month.</p>\n\n<p>I came here to ask two things: Is there a way to solve the former continuous model question? Or is the latter question using the basic EOQ model formula closer to being correct?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance, this has been bothering me for the past two days. </p>",

B&H has been successfully sued several times for discriminating against non-Jewish employees,including for paying them less than Jewish employees, and blocking them from management positions.  In the article, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who is an Orthodox rabbi and an author of several Jewish business books is quoted in the article as saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lapin maintains that none of the aforementioned allegations undermine B&H’s integrity. “Where in the Torah does it say that you have to pay all employees the same rate? Where in the Torah is equality depicted as a virtue? The answer is nowhere at all.” The company’s business model, according to Lapin, adheres to God’s plan insofar as it’s described in, “His book.”</p>\n  \n  <p>“The notion that there’s a moral flaw in people who, because they don’t pay all their employees the same — I’m not sure I see the basis for that in morality. It may not be fair, it may not be legal, those are not my areas. But to say that there is a clash with Jewish values simply would not be true,” said Lapin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is Lapin's view correct? <strong>Excluding dina d'malchuta issues</strong>, is it correct that there is no moral problem in Judaism with discrimination?  If so, what sources support this claim?</p>",

    "Title": "Memory leak problem using Irrlicht engine",
    "Body": "<p>I am using Irrlicht 1.8.1 as part of my game project. Recently I have been struggling with the fullscreen toggling problem, once Irrlicht does not have a default way to alternate fullscreen/unfullscreen at run-time. You have to set this option at the start. This way I had to rewrote the code to make all the engine restart at F11's pressing, the button to toggle, saving all the previous states to make the transition hidden to the player.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, something went wrong and at some time it was made clear that memory leak appeared somewhere during the reset transition. Every time F11 is pressed you can see on Windows Task Bar that the memory used by the software increases mysteriously. I wrote a loop to continuously fullscreen/unfullscreen and left it for some minutes. The needed memory on Task Bar increased from 20k to 30k in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I reviewed all my code multiple times trying to find out what might be wrong. The search pointed me up to a specific point in my code, exactly where the Irrlicht device is to be restarted. To test it I made the following:</p>\n\n<p>I removed this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Finish the old device\ndevice->closeDevice();\ndevice->drop();\n\n// Create new device\ndevice = createDeviceEx( params );\n\n// Return new device\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Return old device without finishing it\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The software simply stopped growing up every time it goes fullscreen or unfullscreen. Obviously the fullscreen/unfullsreen stopped working. I know Windows Task Bar is a very crude way to test memory leaks, but the problem is clear. Anyway, I am still learning. I do not know if I am closing the device and replacing it the right way and that is why I may be still leaving some garbage on memory.</p>\n\n<p>I would like some guide here.</p>",

When I turn the induction panel on, instead of showing 0 on all plates, it is now flashing F-5-F-5 on all plates. Sometimes when I turn it on, it works just fine again, but most of the time it's showing the F-5 error code. </p>\n\n<p>I talked to support, and they told me it was most likely something wrong with one of the two chips inside of the oven, and that I could buy one from them and replace it myself. The chip cost 200 USD...... So I got it, replaced the old one, and still have the same problem. I called them back, and they said they take no returns from private customers, so now I'm out 200 bucks on nothing. They also said that this most likely means there's something wrong with the other chip, which is 400 bucks. Still no guarantee that it's going to work. </p>\n\n<p>Since it's sometimes working and sometimes not, it seems weird to me that it's necessary to replace one of these chips - a bad connection seems more likely. Do any of you know any other solutions i could try? Here is an image of the chip I bought: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3</a></p>",

So I only took the question as asked, and looked also at\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia</a>,</p>\n\n<p>And the concept, as presented, looks very arbitrary to me.</p>\n\n<p>Here are examples involving the verbs <em>open</em> and <em>float</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1.a: The door opened,</p>\n  \n  <p>1.b: He opened the door to a small garden,</p>\n  \n  <p>2.a: The trunk floated,</p>\n  \n  <p>2.b: He floated the trunks down the river,</p>\n  \n  <p>2.c: The man floated near his capsized boat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the analysis of a previous question, case 1.a is an\nergative use of the verb <em>open</em>, used transitively in 1.b. But then\nthe sentences 2.a and 2.b should be analyzed in the same way, which\nimplies that 2.a is an ergative use of the verb <em>float</em>. But then,\nsentence 2.c should also be ergative. Is that the case?</p>\n\n<p>And then, in successive variations, what of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The man stood near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The dog walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked his dog near his boat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>About question 1</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>'s answer is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In linguistics, an ergative verb is a verb that can be either\n    transitive or intransitive, and whose subject when intransitive\n    corresponds to its direct object when transitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be illustrated by the question examples. But if you look\nat the second example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He fired a gun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can also say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun fired a bullet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and that is transitive.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the verb <em>shoot</em> is used.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He shot the gun</p>\n  \n  <p>He shot a man</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a bullet</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a man</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though I am not sure one would say intransitively</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun shot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it all seems a bit more complicated that the simple rule of\nWikipedia and your first question,</p>",

    "Body": "<p>Say someone calls a web service on a server, the relevant data is being retrieved in batches and the message is being streamed to the client. In the middle of the message some kind of exception is encountered. My current implementation sort of just stops streaming the (in this case soap) message and starts building an error message, but obviously the result won't be a valid message or even valid XML.</p>\n\n<p>I considered a few options, none of them seem to make much sense:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Put all the relevant data in memory and then only stream the message itself.</li>\n<li>Do a double-take, so see if it works out with a fake stream and then do the real stream.</li>\n<li>Stream to a disk first and then use a file input stream to stream to the client</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see all have serious downsides in terms of memory/disk consumption, speed/resource efficiency or even validity of the data. How would I best implement error handling in this situation? Do I just have to pick the least worst of these options? If so I tend to favor to the current situation where the message is just invalid in cases like these, because it at least doesn't affect the base case where everything is fine.</p>",

    "Title": "Blender Texture Bake Problems",
    "Body": "<p>Hopefully someone can help. I tried to ask this in the question section, but I am not permitted to start new topics yet. This is partially a Unity question and partially a Blender question. I will be asking in both places. Thank you all in advance for any help.</p>\n\n<p>I'm new to CG and have been self educating for the past few months. I have progressed fairly well, but I can't seem to get exactly what I want with my objects when they are displayed in Unity. I would like them to appear as they do in Blender when they are rendered, but I can't seem to duplicate the effects in Unity.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue I have seems to somehow relate to scaling the texture prior to baking. Objects that do not require scaling prior to the bake to get the texture to display properly (e.g...Rocks) import to Unity perfectly, but Objects that require scaling (e.g....BlockWalls) to get the texture to display correctly go haywire when they are baked (Rock and Ruins were both baked the same way, only difference was the scaling, which I used a Texture Coordinate [UV] and Mapping Vector in Blender to position and scale). The textures show as a black field interspersed with small images of the textured UV unwrapped faces at various intervals on the surface of the object when applied in unity. I believe this is some type of issue with the interplay of light baking to the surface and scaling. </p>\n\n<p>I am able to get the textures into Unity just fine without baking and just save the image files and the .blend directly into Unity, but that's where the texture quality loss is happening. I have also tried various other modifications within Unity to attempt to restore some of the quality lost (e.g.... Bump/Diffuse. Parallax Diffuse, Self Illuminated Bump Diffuse/Parallax Diffuse etc... I do have proper Normal Maps and Parallax Maps, made via Crazy Bump and Gimp).</p>\n\n<p>Also, when I am baking the texture image in Blender, I am in Cycles Render - Object and Image are selected. </p>\n\n<p>I am including screenshots for examples. Any help would be immensely appreciated. <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9NsAn.jpg\" alt=\"Unbaked Texture in Blender\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IVsnA.jpg\" alt=\"Baked Texture in Unity3D\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykF5j.jpg\" alt=\"Rock Texture Baked in Unity3D, Same method, no scaling\"></p>",
