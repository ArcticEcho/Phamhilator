		"Body" : "<p>OK Mo'ne Davis is a horrible example.  Chances are she doesn't grow at all and her fastball hits 75 mph max.  Many 13 year old girls are fully grown, height-wise.  I have personally been around 2 very athletic girls that were very similar to her - one as an umpire and another I personally coached.  The girls at 13 are just more mature than boys of that age psychologically and developmentally.  Boys hit their growing spurt around 14-15.  So girls have two years in school that they might be faster or more talented in the strength/speed sports.  [Actually 4 years ago one of my boys played against a 12 year old girl in football that was laying kids out.  She is talented and will probably have multiple big-time college offers for 2-3 sports but you would laugh if she had football pads on now.  She's 5-8 120 pounds... almost the same size as when she played football]</p>\n\n<p>I want a disclaimer to my answer in that I am pretty strict what I consider a sport.  Auto racing, board games, and strategy games are not sports to me.  I personally feel that bowling is not a sport (but a great game) and golf is right on the lowest fringe of sport.</p>\n\n<p>Do women have a chance?  Well not anytime soon.  They just don't have the physical attributes that will help them, unless they start altering their physical attributes.  I remember my college (large D1 school) having the WNBA players stay in the dorms over the summer.  I was on the basketball practice team.  Was probably at the level of a DIII starter but nothing great.  We would play the WNBA girls daily.  My team would include 1-2 guys from practice squade and 2-3 \"good\" pickup players. </p>\n\n<p>In their three weeks there the WNBA players never won a game.  They scratched, clawed, brought out their 6-7 big, it didn't matter.  They couldn't stop our first step or the power drive.   Number don't lie.  We won probably close to 100 games.  Most of these girls were stars at big D1 programs.  We didn't hold back at all (mainly because they started playing dirty in game one) but we weren't also \"great\" players.  I believe all of the girls we played were better basketball players than us - fundamentals, shooting, tactic, positioning, whatever - but the athletic disadvantage was too much to make up.</p>\n\n<p>What sport are women closest to catching men?  I would think it would be the marathon.  Running that distance requires using your body's existing fat reserves.  Women have an advantage here.  They can possibly be lean and in race shape with more fat in their body.  </p>",

They chose to define it as a player who establishes control of the ball, lands on the field, and then holds it for long enough to do something else. This something else is commonly referred to as a football move. </p>\n\n<p>This seems like a reasonable enough line to draw because if a player has the time and wherewithal to do something else, he's probably done catching the ball. If he doesn't, he's probably still in the process of catching the ball.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nEzra</p>",

It's a fun 'puzzle' and since you decide where to hide the rewards, the difficulty level is adjustable. As my dog has gotten better at finding the hidden treats I've had to come up with more advanced places to hide them (inside old shoe boxes, underneath her dog bed...etc.) If you try this technique and your dog is already a bit destructive you might want to be extra mindful of where you hide the treats (so you're not encouraging your dog to destroy or mess up anything else)</p>\n\n<p>For a more high tech solution there are weird robot toys that play with your dog while you're away...something like this:  <a href=\"http://goifetch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goifetch.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to add that one of the best ways to make your dog less restless while your away is to tire your dog out while you are around.

The Multi-server feature seems to be very limited, but it could be so much better with a little effort.  I figure it will be removed from the product one of these years, fixed, and then added back as a great \"new\" feature in the ENT edition.  </p>\n\n<p>I think the limitation is in the extended procs such as xp_msx_enlist code.  They determine the name of the local instance.  If it was T-SQL code, it might have been easier to fix.  As far as I can tell, the only place the target name is stored is in msdb.dbo.systargetservers table on the master server.  If the targets could be tricked into requesting a sync for the FSDN, then the table could have be updated (hacked) directly to use the FQDN.  </p>\n\n<p>If it was open source, it would have been fixed years ago.  It would have had more features by now too.  </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I am currently playing through Borderlands 2 for the fourth time and have yet to see The Warrior drop the first legendary anything.  I farmed him literally 6-8 hours a day for over 2 weeks, at the time it took roughly 10 minutes to kill him and he never dropped a legendary unless it went into the lava.  As far as Terramorphous goes, the only legendary anything it has dropped has been slayer of terramorphous mods.....never anything else.  I have literally had better luck buying legendary weapons in vending machines than getting either of those to drop one.  I have seen chubby varkids drop a crappy launcher, chubby spiderants drop a shield that wasn't worth picking up..other than that, the only items I have seen drop have been slayer of terramorphous and that's all....gearbox really needs to do something about the shoddy drop rates.  I don't mean they should drop some legendary every time, but they should at least have a 5% chance of dropping SOMETHING besides crap items.  And by the way, I cannot play online so getting someone to \"dupe\" anything for me is out of the question...wouldn't want that anyway, no point in having it if I didn't get it myself</p>",

They used to mean that you owned a stock or had sold a stock short.  Now they are often used to say you make money when a value goes up (long) or make money when some value goes down (short).</p>\n\n<p>In this case whenever you own a call or a put you are \"long\" volatility.  Meaning that as volatility increases the value of your position increases (holding everything else the same).  How much added value that you get for an certain increase in volatility (called vega) <a href=\"http://totaloptions.com.au/818/introduction-to-options-trading-option-vega/\" rel=\"nofollow\">depends on how in/out of the money the option is at currently</a> among other things, but if you own the call/put it is always positive as more volatility means more possible upside.</p>\n\n<p>When you sell calls or puts then volatility decreases are good for your position so you are called \"short\" vol.</p>",

		"Title" : "I am currently dealing with the same thing, and have been for a while no...",
		"Body" : "<p>I am currently dealing with the same thing, and have been for a while now. The comments are harsh judgements like you think the asker was given a parenting handbook and that the information provided here is something that only idiots and bad parents don't know. I hear child development and education backgrounds, maybe some psychology/behavioral health. YOU  should know this stuff, yes. Is it something that a normal run-of-the-mill parent should? No. Not unless they bury their face in books and can decide to agree with one of the many conflicting theories of \"good parenting\". </p>\n\n<p>Some of us have no \"good\" examples of how things are supposed to be done and are just trying to not make the same mistakes as our parents. The advice seems valid and well delivered but did it really have to be preceded by implicit scoffs and 'How could you be so stupid\"-like comments?</p>\n\n<p>Expectations are not set too high when you expect your child to do simple tasks without every day being an argument...for EVERY task.</p>\n\n<p>Well let me tell you. I have been dealing with my 10 y/o son not showing interest in ANYTHING and dragging butt about everything in his daily tasks. I have tried everything. I STARTED with explaining why it's important to brush teeth and take a good shower everyday. I asked the exact preferences that were listed here:</p>\n\n<p>\"Do you want to shower at night or in the morning?\" \n\"Do you want to brush your teeth before or after breakfast?\" \n\"Do you want to play for a little while before you start homework?\" \n\"How about after a snack?\"\n\"Do you want to do your homework at the breakfast bar or table?\" \n\"Do you think it would be easier to stay focused or more comfortable if you had a desk in your room? Let's try and see.\" </p>\n\n<p>I have provided encouragement, enforced consequences, provided positive reinforcement, and taken things away. We have time-outs for when either of us get frustrated and we both go to our own spaces to reflect and regroup. I have tried a LOT of different ways to skin this cat. What works for some does not ALWAYS work ALL of the time. I find that as soon as I find something that seems like it is working, it just doesn't and I have to change methods. That has been going on since he was 2 or 3. </p>\n\n<p>I also have an 11 y/o daughter. I have used the same parenting style with her from the beginning. She is autonomous, successful in anything she tries, and interested in everything. She is smart, has great friends, and has great confidence. Different cat.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with some of the comments is that they seem abrasive and sound condescending. Why not ask questions like:\n \"What kind of encouragement have you tried?\"\n\"Which tasks are the most difficult?\"\n\"Have you sat him down when not trying to get him to do something and just asked how he feels about each thing? Why does he think or feel like he does about fulfilling his responsibilities?\" \n\"There have been no \"diagnoses\" in the family but have you considered taking him to speak with someone anyway?\" </p>\n\n<p>Talking to someone that is trained to communicate with children can be helpful. Sometimes it is just an issue of parents not knowing how to communicate with their child. I am still trying to figure it out myself. Kids can be 10 different people by the time they reach double digits. </p>\n\n<p>I say (a couple of years too late) good job for caring enough to seek guidance. We don't have all of the answers and sometimes it takes the wisdom of the village to survive the parent-child relationship. That being said, the villager should be able to ask for the wisdom without feeling attacked. I understand that the asker may have not read the responses that way but I did. So may others that stumble upon this post. All I typed in the search engine was \"how to help my child find interests\". </p>\n\n<p>How about trying to build up or encourage the parent? Do we not still need it? Or, is it a good idea to criticize someone that may already be feeling less-than great about how they're doing in one of life's most challenging tasks? People don't grow out of needing support.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, my son has outgrown the fighting me on things. Most of the time he just complains and whines about everything or will do bare minimum at best without me staying on him. </p>\n\n<p>One thing to help with brushing teeth that parents can try is using the pre-rinse that stains the \"yuk\" on teeth so they see how they're doing. The first time they get it all off before you check is self-rewarding for them. Also, the timed electric toothbrushes help them realize how long it really takes. We use the Sonicare for kids by Phillips. It beeps every 30 seconds letting them know when to switch sections. They can pause it to spit and you can hear it go throught the cycle without having to watch them like a hawk. The vibration tickles for a few days but they get used to it. Another good thing about it is that if they don't put a lot of physical work into it, the toothbrush still gets the job done as long as they actually move it to each part. I'm not endorsing that specific brand, I just don't have knowledge of other brands' features. It is definitely more expensive than regular toothbrushes but for me, worth it in what I save at the dentist. Huge improvement in dental health after the switch.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Briefly, no.</p>\n\n<p>Charged particle interaction is fundamentally a non-instantaneous photon exchange. The interaction can be written or expanded as the ''naive'' instantaneous interaction ($e^2/r$) plus a photon exchange portion which contains exactly a $-e^2/r$ term and a non-instantaneous (retarded in time) term. The author calls the first term the Coulomb interaction, and he calls the second the photon interaction. (We note that the sum of these two results in the cancelling of the instantaneous $e^2/r$ term, giving us a time-dependent expression for charged particle interaction, as expected.)</p>\n\n<p>Then I think the author says that since distances are small, times are also small, and so the instantaneous Coulomb term dominates. Thus it is acceptable in most cases to use the naive 19th century Coulomb definition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit2</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the author is being very semantically confusing, and even contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>The author is using a loose definition of the word \"interaction\" (as was I, before this edit).\nStrictly speaking, the expression \"$e^2/r$\" does not describe an interaction, but rather just tells us the strength of the force. That is, it doesn't say at all <em>how</em> the force arises, it just describes the end result. (Note the analogy to Newtonian vs Einsteinian gravity.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus you would call it the Coulomb Law; \"Coulomb Interaction\" is something that does not exist, or has not yet been proposed (since it would be an instantaneous action-at-a-distance mechanism). As far as we know, all charged particle interaction takes place by exchanging photons. (You could call the exchange of photons the \"Coulomb Interaction\", but then there wouldn't be the distinction that the author makes.)</p>\n\n<p>The author is essentially trying to say that we can ignore the mechanism by which the charged particles interact, and study only the resultant forces and effects arising from their interaction.\nIt would be acceptable, in my opinion, to ignore that somewhat misleading paragraph of the text.</p>",

		"Title" : "Removing entire lines from text with regex, ignoring duplicates and only leaving lines according to criteria",
		"Body" : "<p>I've been working on a project to manipulate text files in c# into something usable that I can pull into excel as a CSV.  I asked another question a few weeks ago which was a definite step in the right direction, however I have some additional constraints that I am trying to figure out.</p>\n\n<p>Link to previous question for background: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23684844/regex-between-and-including-characters-across-multiple-lines/23686350?noredirect=1#comment36992448_23686350\">Original Question</a></p>\n\n<p>The input text file (an example of which is below) has several types of data associated with documents that are stored in a database.  The data is broken into sections for each document, which is denoted by a \"BEGIN:\".  The original regular expression removed most of the line breaks, removed data labels, as well as a line labeled \"Ad Hoc\" which I elected to remove because it was not present in every file, so when I brought it into excel it would misalign the columns.</p>\n\n<p>After looking at additional text files that were the output of this database, I have discovered that there are more inconsistencies, so since I really only need 2 or 3 pieces of data from this, I think it would be easiest to remove everything except what is needed.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to use pipes (which I have come to understand is an \"or\" operator in regex) to try to add additional conditions to the expression, but once I added more than one additional condition it would start to skip the following conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my requirements, and below I will paste in example text:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I only need 2 data items from each document section: Document Handle and FileName.</li>\n<li>At the bottom of the text file there is an additional portion of the file path denoted by \"\\\"</li>\n<li>In some text files, filename and the path at the bottom are repeated, but are the same</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The text files which are the output of the document database we are using is pretty useless as it is.  My goal is to be able to pull something into excel which has the document handle and filename for each document (each section starting with \"BEGIN:\" is a separate document) and the complete file path at the bottom.  So far I have been using a semicolon to deliniate the text when pulling it into excel.</p>\n\n<p>Sample Text:</p>\n\n<pre><code>>>>>Self Configuring Tagged DIP<<<<\nBEGIN:\n>>DocTypeName: System

Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private int jumpPointer;\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchDown(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if((x > (5*width)/7 && y < (2*height)/7)) {\n        controller.jumpPressed(); //make the character jump\n        jumpPointer = pointer;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchUp(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if (pointer == jumpPointer && Gdx.app.getType().equals(ApplicationType.Android))\n        controller.jumpReleased();\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, pointer is a bit oddly named in my opinion.  TouchIndex would probably have made more sense, especially with pointer having a pair of very well defined meanings already.  The pointer value is value between 0 and n (defined as 20 in LibGDX, in reality much lower) that represents the ORDER in which the touch event occurred in the event of multiple simultaneous touches.  Therefore if you have multiple fingers touching, a pointer value of 0 would indicate that this touch event represents the first finger to touch the screen, while a value of 3 would be the fourth finger to touch the screen.</p>",

		"Title" : "Like others have said, firewall, and if you feel it necessary IDS/IPS to...",
		"Body" : "<p>Like others have said, firewall, and if you feel it necessary IDS/IPS too.  But to me, it's the wrong question.  You need to address these things:</p>\n\n<h2>Forensics</h2>\n\n<p>Have you managed to work out how you were comprimised before?  If not, it would be a good place to start.  Knowing how your system ended up with a RAT on it in the first place means you can close off that door</p>\n\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned by a few others, firewall that stuff.  A box running two NICs and using   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall\" rel=\"nofollow\">UFW</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iptables</a> to filter traffic is a good start, although make sure that box is itself very locked down.  Consider whether you need to run each service on the firewall box too.  e.g. if it's in the same room as you, does it need SSH/telnet running, or can you just use it in person?</p>\n\n<h2>IDS/IPS</h2>\n\n<p>If you consider it necessary, you could even add an Intrusion Protection/Detection System to the box.  There are <a href=\"https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/security-essentials/open-source-intrusion-detection-tools-a-quick-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">several freeware tools</a> to consider in this regard.</p>\n\n<h2>System hardening</h2>\n\n<p>Both on the box you proxy through, and the box you develop on, consider some hardening.  Get a software firewall that is good for your OS, and antivirus for that OS too, and ideally some way to check regularly for Rootkits etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Good practices</h2>\n\n<p>More important than any of the above is to adopt good practices.  It's no good setting up a hardware firewall if you then open ports whenever something doesn't work, and forget to address whether they need to stay open, and it's no good installing a rootkit finder if you never run it.</p>\n\n<p>All of this said, base what you do on a risk assessment (useful to know how previous exploits worked for risk assessment, too), and don't go overboard.  You could spend a week building a nice little setup with custom hardware firewalls, IDS/IPS protection, hardware level AV, and all manner of other stuff, but if you'd do better with a simpler set up and spending that time working, consider whether that's a better idea.</p>\n\n<h2>Audit</h2>\n\n<p>Try and find a decent security audit tool for your system.  If you are running linux, I find <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/tiger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tiger</a> is pretty good, </p>\n\n<h2>Opportunism</h2>\n\n<p>The likelihood is that you weren't targeted.  Statistically speaking, people trying to make money out of security holes in a criminal way (like holding code to ransom) aren't seeking out particular individuals to exploit, but rather people who fit a certain demographic.  It's more likely that you were exploited last time because some script kiddie could find a dev server of some sort running or something like that, and was scanning for these particular things in order to perform the exploit on you that they did.  Your biggest aim is to make yourself hard to find and then target, as this is a much more likely scenario than a direct target of you and only you.  The other thing that makes me think this is that you were extorted for money, whereas a targetted attack would probably be trying to steal your code and keep it.</p>\n\n<p>Consider whether you may have been targeted, but I think on the whole, closing any security holes you can find will be a good first step.  I think you can probably avoid this problem again with just the firewall, but a lot depends on how you were comprimised.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Wow, this one is hard.<br>\nA very good idea is distinguishing between topics and people (like Kilian did). Maybe some more examples will help.</p>\n\n<p>You usually talk <em>about</em> a topic and generalize it to some point. The German \"\u00FCber\" does the same just like in \"\u00DCbersicht\". You ask somebody to tell you <em>about</em> something to get an impression. When I tell you something <em>about</em> a topic I am giving you more like a summary so you get the idea.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is he talking about?. - \u00DCber was spricht er?<br>\n  (<em>He is talking about nature (in general)</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I talk <em>of</em> a certain topic I (maybe) want to convince/win you. I think the contents are more important here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He is talking of nature and it's different animals. - Er redet von der Natur und den verschiednen Tieren.<br>\n  (Ending the sentence after \"nature\" in both languages feels odd because you expect something else to follow. At least I do.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><br>To sum up:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did he tell you <strong>about</strong> something? - is generally asking (\u00FCber).<br>\n  Did you hear <strong>of</strong> this thing? - is going further into detail (von).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some special case might be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Someone is talking well <strong>of</strong> you. (von, detail: talking <em>well</em>)<br>\n  Someone is talking <strong>about</strong> you (\u00FCber, in general, no judging)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Speaking of \"of\" and \"about\", I'm about to go off (so much confusion :D)</p>",

		"Title" : "Play Audio on Android",
		"Body" : "<p>Answers to many questions about this theme doesn't help me! It's not the problem that audio needs to be started first by a click or any other type of action.</p>\n\n<p>I want to Play a number of different short mp3's on my website. The best approach I've found is the following. It works on Internet Explorer and Chrome (other Desktop browsers not tested) and on mobile devices with iOS. But not on Android.</p>\n\n<p>In my html I initialize an audio device:</p>\n\n<pre><code><audio id=\"mp3play\" src=\"\"></audio>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's only for defining the name \"mp3play\".</p>\n\n<p>In the header of the html I have the following javascript:</p>\n\n<pre><code><SCRIPT language=JavaScript> \n<!--\nfunction play(name) {\n        var oAudio = document.getElementById(\"mp3play\");\n        oAudio.stop;\n        oAudio.src = name;\n        oAudio.play();\n}\n\n//-->\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now I can invoke the player with the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('stuff/voc/WAVvow/011001.MP3');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine, even on Android.</p>\n\n<p>But for special requirements I do not use filenames for mp3's. I've made a Perl script to deliver the pm3 data depending on a computation. For this I use the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('../cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This Perl code \"playmp3.pl\" sends a header and then the complete mp3 data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ($entry[0] has a pointer to the desired data, $entry[1] the length)\n    open(DAT, \"<../wbtde/DictData/dv8.dat\");\n    binmode DAT;\n    seek(DAT, $entry[0], 0);\n    read(DAT, $mp3, $entry[1]);       # Lesen des Eintrages\n    close DAT;\n    print \"Content-type: audio/mpeg\\n\\n\"; \n    print $mp3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this works fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browsers, but not on Android. </p>\n\n<p>I can invoke the script also directly with</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this is working fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browser, but not on Android. Android tells me it can not play this type of content. But with content type audio/mpeg3 it's also not playing.</p>\n\n<p>This is the Android error log when I tap one link only:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another try:\nI've saved the output from Perl script to a file with the name \"test.MP3\".

So I can assume that the output of the Perl script is correct.</p>\n\n<p>Is it a question of content type?</p>\n\n<p>Is it a question of the filename (.pl instead of mp3)?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Finally, solved the problem. It appears VMware takes a very different path. The question was misconstrued.</p>\n\n<p>First, I traced the connection using WireShark, and at no point the server asks (need or  want) a certificate. However, VirtualCenter (VC) does provide a way to register a certificate as part of a connection and then use that certificate authenticate. For this to work, they provide a way to tunnel connections.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence I used is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First specify the URL to connect to as https://: (note the protocol is secure, but the port is not).</p></li>\n<li><p>The initial socket will be opened to the clear text port. But having https as the protocol will force calling my own SSLSocketFactory. In my socket factory, I get a call to my <code>public Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)</code> method, which allows me to convert my socket to SSLSocket to my taste.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My code essentially looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)\n    throws IOException {\n    s.setKeepAlive(true);\n    String connectReq = \"CONNECT /sdkTunnel HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\n    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\n    writer.write(connectReq, 0, connectReq.length());\n    writer.flush();\n    // In this initial response, all that matters is the http code. If\n    // it is 200, the rest can be ignored.\n    READ_AND_VERIFY_INITIAL_RESPONSE();\n    SSLSocket sock = (SSLSocket) origSslSockFactory\n        .createSocket(s, s.getInetAddress().getHostName(), s.getPort(), true);\n    // Depending on whether the caller actually does the handshake\n    // or not, you may need to call handshake here. In my case, I\n    // did not need to, since HTTPClient I am using calls the\n    // handshake. Axis does not call, so you may have to in that\n    // case.\n\n    // sock.startHandshake();\n    return sock;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above block, origSslSockFactory is the SSLSocketFactory that got replaced by your implementation. In my case it was an instance of sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketFactoryImpl.</p>\n\n<p>After that procedure, calling ExtensionManager.setExtensionCertificate() succeeds. And subsequently, all calls to SessionManager.loginExtensionByCertificate() also succeeds. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to post this as there seem to be a lot of questions about this.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>In some Semitic languages, the consonant <em>w</em> seems to have become <em>y</em> (a palatal glide) in certain positions: for example Arabic <strong><em>w</em></strong><em>alid</em> \"newborn\", Hebrew <strong><em>y</em></strong><em>eled</em> \"child\", or Arabic <strong><em>w</em></strong><em>araq</em> \"leaves, foliage\", Hebrew <strong><em>y</em></strong><em>aroq</em> \"green\".</p>\n\n<p>Are there any theories on the mechanism of this change?

		"Body" : "<p>Many thanks to all of you! I think you all have good points, and the real answer to my question would be a combination of these.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: Economic or climatic (lack of ressources) pressures couldn't do the trick</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy point out above, these types of pressure can only force a population drop for a limited amount of time. Indeed when the humans are less numerous, then the pressure fades and restrained fertility rise again.<br>\nAs the population is spread on a lot of planets, the risk for a great catastrophe to kill enough humans at once to get passed the minimal amount for specie perpetuation is also really unlikely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: It's all about culture!</strong><br>\nAs @Mark remarks in his answer, even if the mainstream culture discourages having lots of children, in time it would be replaced by the subcultures with higher fertility rates.<br>\nEven if global human fertility is decreasing, (for w/e reason) the individuals from the fertile subcultures willing to have children will try everything in order to do so, and probably succeed thanks to advanced science. (in vitro fecondation and so on) As @Vincent points out, individuals mostly do see their interest before such things as their specie's destiny.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes: It would require intervention of a greater institution or entity</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy emphasise, the only way to go past these barriers is to postulate that an extremely well informed and patient institution or entity works in the shadows to lower the overall fertility (using viruses or chemicals) and break the most fertile subcultures. (using manipulation)<br>\nI think we proved here that this is necessary as else evolution or fertile subcultures (that we can see as a social mutation towards specie surviving) would always take over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative possibility: coincidences</strong><br>\nThe only other way is if an extremely unlucky chain of coincidences happens. For example first the economic pressure makes couples less eager to procreate, then a few catastrophic events dynamite the most fertile subcultures, while a very hardcore sect takes over...<br>\nWith the dramatic combination of all these economic, climatic and cultural factors, humanity could end up being a very infertile and fanatic small group of individuals.</p>",

		"Title" : "MySQL replication error when an event is expired and dropped automatically",
		"Body" : "<p>I have an event that ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00, and a replication error was caused by <code>drop event ***</code> statement, coz the slave complains that the event does not exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit more background: we have about 10 MySQL master/slave pairs, each running independently, with identical config(all managed by chef). An event was created previously on all masters, and when the event expired, half of the slaves has a replication error, caused by the <code>drop event</code> statement, while the other half were fine. I checked with one pair of master/slave, both binlog and relay log shows there was a <code>drop event</code> statement at about 2014-01-21 10:06:00(the event actually ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00), while the 'fine' ones seem not having the <code>drop event</code> statement at all.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html</a>, the event is supposed to be immediately dropped once is has expired. </p>\n\n<p>So I did a simple test. First create an event on master, I can see both master and slave has this event, while the status of that event on the slave is 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED', which is expected. </p>\n\n<pre><code>DELIMITER |\nDROP EVENT IF EXISTS `test_event` |\nCREATE EVENT `test_event`\nON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 MINUTE STARTS '2015-01-22 15:45:00' ENDS '2015-01-22 15:48:00'\n  DO BEGIN\n    insert into t values ();\n  END |\nDELIMITER ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At 15:48, the event on both master & slave was gone. I check the binlog and relay log, both show that there was a <code>DROP EVENT test.test_event</code> at 2015-01-22 15:48:00, which looks quite fine.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: \n1. Among the 10 master/slave pairs, any idea why half the master did not execute <code>drop event ***</code> at all when the event expired, while the other half did, but late for several minutes, and the event on the slave is already gone(while a simple test worked just as expected)? Or where should I look at besides the binlog and relay log?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>All events on the slaves are gone already, those without a replication error doesn't have the <code>drop event</code> statement in relay log at all. So how did those event gone in the first place?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>PS: MySQL version is 5.5.29-29.4-log Percona Server</p>",

		"Title" : "What is the proper way to organize those connections between classes in OOP",
		"Body" : "<p>There is some pattern in my code, that I have rather often, but never know how to organize those classes properly. Let's look at the most recent (simplified) example. It is written in C#, but I would assume that the \"solution\" generally applies to any OOP language. </p>\n\n<p>There are 3 classes: <code>Planet</code>, <code>Storage</code> and <code>Population</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Each <code>Planet</code> can have a Population and may have one or several Storages, with one being the main one. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>Population</code> among other things also has to eat, and for that draws the food from the main Storage of the Planet. This happens when the <code>Planet.Update()</code> is called, which then again also calls <code>Population.Update()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now my question is, how to properly model those connections between those 3 classes. I personally see a few options, but I'm not sure, which is the right one.</p>\n\n<p>a) Not make a separate Storage and Population class, but do it all in the Planet class. - This feels crude and unhandy, especially as those classes are quite big and merging all those, only because there is a very small overlap (small compared to the overall functionality of those classes), feels simply wrong.</p>\n\n<p>b) Each time <code>Population.Update()</code> is called, give the reference to the Storage as Parameter. - This is, what I am doing right now. It feels like a lot of redundancy and useless cluttering of the <code>Population.Update()</code>-signature though. Pretty much this parameter will be identical to the last call 99.99% of the time.</p>\n\n<p>c) Store permanently in the Population, from which Storage it should draw. - This targets the complaint I had with b), but brings new problems. Now I have to remember, that every time I change the main storage of the Planet, I also have to tell this to the Population. (or for whatever other reasons the used storage of the Planet changes) I have no doubt, I would remember doing that, if I were to change the Planet class in the next few weeks, but if I decide to work on it again in a year, I may run into troubles, because I forgot it.</p>\n\n<p>d) Store permanently in the Population, to which Planet it belongs, and add a method to the Planet, that returns a reference to its main storage. - This is sort of a mix between b) and c). It cleans up the signature of my <code>Population.Update()</code> and does not run into the troubles I see with c), but of course it requires a mostly redundant method call to get the <code>Storage</code> each time <code>Population.Update()</code> is called.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At least in the US, graduate admissions committees tend to look at many factors. The three \"big\" areas tend to be your recommendation letters, personal statement, and standardized scores. They probably will look at your CV as well. You might be able to make up for a deficit in one area with strengths in other areas. For example, admissions committees might favor an applicant with at least one published paper prior to his/her application, even if he/she does not have the best GPA or GRE scores out of the entire applicant pool. I am less familiar with admissions outside of the US.Unfortunately, there isn't any one magic formula to guarantee admission to any program.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, I think you are correct in wondering how your GRE score will impact your chances of admission. Assuming that you took the most updated form of the GRE (where the range is 130-170 instead of 200-800 for each section), your score is quite low since you scored 35 points above the absolute minimum score. Most competitive graduate programs claim that successful applicants have GRE scores in at least the 50th percentile. As such, your low GRE score would likely be a major red flag for these programs. However, other programs tend to overlook GRE scores entirely (they will say you don't need to submit them) or weight them fairly low.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way that you can postpone your applications and retake the GRE? If not, you need to put together the best application possible, which means putting extra effort and attention into the other parts of your application, like your personal statement. You might also consider applying to programs that explicitly do not require standardized scores or weigh them low, which means that if the GRE is the only weak point of your application, you're likely fine. Again, there is no way of any of us knowing what you can do to guarantee admission, but in your situation, I would suggest that you make the things still within your control the best they can be.</p>",

		"Title" : "Well, I planned to just write the relevant parts of the program but I en...",
		"Body" : "<p>Well, I planned to just write the relevant parts of the program but I ended up writing an entire working program instead. Since I don't know how much Python you know I'm just going to explain the entire program; sorry if I have a somewhat pedantic and/or pompous air. Feel free to just skip to the bottom and copy the code.</p>\n\n<p>The code I wrote demonstrates 4 Python idioms: object oriented design, bytearray/string slicing and formatting, the xrange() function, and error catching.</p>\n\n<p>I think that csv would not be a good angle to approach the problem with. I opted to store the data as a text table. Each line takes the following form:\n30 characters name | 10 characters total score | 9 characters attempts | 1 newline\nThe benefit of this is that each line is exactly 50 characters wide. So, unlike the csv approach, we don't have to scan through for commas to find relevent data; we just go through the data in increments of 50 characters. This makes for much more readable code, and it's not like text storage space is at a premium these days.</p>\n\n<p>Example: Chell R earned 42 points in 5 attempts becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"                       Chell R        42        5\\n\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since we're going to be sorting  this data later, it would be advantageous to store both the student's name and his/her score in an object. This object makes sorting much simpler; because the name is permanently attatched to the score, we don't have to worry about making sure the name data follows the score data as the data is sorted. It just happens implicitly.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first portion of the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import time, random, operator\ndirectory_name = r\"C:\\Users\\YOU\\yourDirectoryHere\\\\\"\n#When you change the directory name, be SURE to include\n#the double backslash at the end.\ndatafile = open(directory_name + \"scores.txt\")\ndata = bytearray(datafile.read())\ndatafile.close()\n\nclass entry():\n    def __init__(self, i):\n        #i is the location of the student's entry in the data.\n        global data\n        self.name = data[i:i + 30]\n        self.total = int(data[i + 30:i + 40])\n        self.attempts = int(data[i + 40:i + 49])\n        if self.attempts:\n            self.average = float(self.total) / self.attempts\n        else: self.average = 0.0\n\n    def update_score(self, score, i):\n        global data, directory_name\n        self.total += score\n        self.attempts += 1\n        self.average = float(self.total) / self.attempts\n        data[i + 30: i + 40] = \"%10i\" % self.total\n        data[i + 40: i + 49] = \"%9i\" % self.attempts\n        datafile = open(directory_name + \"scores.txt\",'w')\n        datafile.write(data)\n        datafile.close()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The method defined under <strong>init</strong> is known as a magic method. This means that unlike the regular method update_score, you don't call the method yourself. It's automatically called by Python; in this case it's called when an entry object is created.</p>\n\n<p>Five things to point out:\n1: Just to quickly explain a syntax annoyance, each method must have self as the first argument and each variable stored in the object needs a self. prefix.</p>\n\n<p>2: Notice that the data read from the file is converted to the bytearray type. Bytearrays are useful because unlike strings they are mutable, so we can update students' scores when neccessary without inefficiently recreating the entire string. I opted to pass data as a global variable instead of a regular argument in order to avoid having to pass it through several layers of functions.</p>\n\n<p>3: The expression foo = bar[x:y] is a slice operation. This means \"Fill variable foo with characters x through y-1 of bar\". I used it in the <strong>init</strong> function in order to initialize the entry's name and score values. The reverse also works, as seen in the update_score method.</p>\n\n<p>4: Another useful trick for string or bytearray formatting inherits from C. Since each total score entry must take up 10 characters in order to keep each entry 50 characters wide, use the string \"%10i\" % self.total in order to force the interger to a 10 character width.</p>\n\n<p>5: Finally, just a quick note that I wrote float(self.total) / self.attempts. Dividing an integer by an integer results in a rounded, inaccurate integer.</p>\n\n<p>The next part of the program is the main play() function, which calls find_entry():</p>\n\n<pre><code>def find_entry(name):\n    global data\n    for i in xrange(0,len(data),50):\n        if data[i:i + 30] == \"%30s\" % name:\n            return i\n    print \"Name not found. Please check the spelling of your name.\"\n    print \"If you spelled your name correctly please ask your teacher for help.\"\n    return None\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The xrange function is first seen in the find_entry function. This provides a much more readable, pythonic way to iterate than while loops. \"for i in xrange(0,len(data),50):\" is equivalent to. \"i = 0; While i < len(data): ... i += 50. Anyway, all it does is go through the data 50 characters at a time (since each entry is 50 characters wide) and check if the first 30 characters match up with the inputted name. (Note that I use data[i:i + 30] == \"%30s\" % name. The inputted name must be pumped up to 30 characters, otherwise the equality operator will always fail). It returns the index i of the found entry if successful and returns None to indicate failure.</p>\n\n<p>Next we'll examine the main play() function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def play():\n    global data\n    entry_num = None\n    while entry_num == None:\n        entry_num = find_entry(raw_input(\"Please enter your name and surname initial (e.g. William G): \"))\n\n    student_entry = entry(entry_num)\n    score = 0\n    for i in xrange(10): #same as xrange(0,10,1)\n        score += question()\n\n    student_entry.update_score(score, entry_num)\n    print \"Your score this time was %i / 10\" % score\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see here that the fact that find_entry returns None upon failure is put to good use. The while loop means the program keeps on trying until a valid name is inputted. Also note the use of the raw_input function. This forces Python to interpret the input as a string. This'll make more sense in the next function, the question function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def question():\n    n1 = random.randint(1,9)\n    n2 = random.randint(1,9)\n    ops = {'+': operator.add, '-': operator.sub, 'x': operator.mul}\n    op = random.choice(ops.keys())\n    answer = raw_input(\"What is %i %s %i?  \" % (n1, op, n2))\n    try: \n        answer = int(answer)\n        if answer == ops[op](n1, n2):\n            print \"Well done\"\n            return 1\n        else:\n            print \"incorrect, %i %s %i = %i\" % (n1, op, n2, ops[op](n1,n2))\n            return 0\n    except ValueError:\n        print \"'%s' does not appear to be a number.\" % answer\n        return 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I pretty much just copied your code verbatim for this part. The only major difference is the addition of the try... except statement and the use of raw_input() in lieu of input(). The issue with input() is that it's pretty unsafe, since Python is free to interpret its input as any type, including a variable name, a bogus input can wreck all sorts of havoc. raw_input is much safer: since Python always interprets the input as a string the programmer gets the right to interpret the input and anticipate errors. In this case, the try... except statement tries to convert the inputted string to an integer with int(). int() raises ValueError if it fails to convert the string to an integer, so an except ValueError statement would execute instead upon failure, communicating the failure to the user and allowing the program to recover instead of crashing.</p>\n\n<p>Now that that's dealt with, we can move on to the actually interesting part of the question: sorting the entries.</p>\n\n<p>Going back to the entry() class definition, there are two additional magic methods which facilitate leaderboard creation, <strong>cmp</strong> and <strong>str</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class entry():\n    def __init__(self, i):\n        ...\n\n    def __cmp__(self, other):\n        return self.average - other.average\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return \"%s | %2.2f\" % (self.name, self.average)\n\n    def update_score(self, score, i):\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <strong>cmp</strong> method is called when Python needs to compare two entries. Since we want the leaderboards to be sorted by average score, not alphabetically or by total score, we return a comparison of this entry's average with the other entry's average (Python interprets a negative return value as self < other and a positive return value as self > other)</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>str</strong> method is what's called when str(a) or print(a) is encountered, where a is an entry type. Since we now must format two pieces of data, the student's name and average, we put the two variables in a tuple after the % sign. The %2.2f tells Python to print a floating point number with only 2 digit after the decimal point; any further digits are ignored.</p>\n\n<p>All the work was done writing the methods. Writing the leaderboard() function thus becomes a trivial affair:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def leaderboard():\n    global data\n    entries = []\n    for i in xrange(0, len(data),50):\n        entries += [entry(i)]\n\n    entries.sort()\n    entries.reverse()\n\n    for i in entries:\n        print i\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see the beauty of object oriented programming at work here. The xrange loop calls the entry's <strong>init</strong> method over and over again, populating the list with entries. This somewhat complex function is safely stowed away in the entry class declaration, keeping the leaderboard function clean and easy to read. Next, the sort() method of Python's built in list object is called, so we don't need to reinvent the wheel writing another sorting algorithm. This calls our <strong>cmp</strong> function, ensuring that Python will correctly sort the entries by average score as intended. Next, we reverse() the list, since we want the highest scores first. Again, no need to write this function ourselves; it comes along with the list type in Python. Finally, we print the leaderboard. This calls the entry class's <strong>str</strong> function, so in the leaderboard function itself we don't need to worry about finding the correct data in the data file. Nice and clean.</p>\n\n<p>Pretty much done here, now all there's to do is write the main loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>while True:\n    print \"\"\"\\\nWelcome to Simple-Maths Questions program\nPlease type one of the following:\nPlay | Leaderboard | Exit\"\"\"\n    command = raw_input()\n    command = command.upper()\n    if command in \"PLAY\":\n        play()\n    elif command in \"LEADERBOARD\":\n        leaderboard()\n    elif command in \"EXIT\":\n        break #You don't have to call quit() to terminate the program, just reach EOF.\n    elif command in \"ADD NAME\":\n        add_student()\n    else:\n        print \"unknown command\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, raw_input() is safer than input(). The keyword is converted to all caps and only finds whether the input is in the keyword, so the input is not case sensitive and there's no need to type the full keyword (This was a timesaver for debugging). Also, there's the hidden command \"ADD NAME\"; I didn't feel like explaining that function. And that's, uh, pretty much all I have to say.</p>\n\n<p>And here is the completed code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import time, random, operator\ndirectory_name = r\"C:\\Users\\YOU\\yourDirectoryHere\\\\\"\n#When you change the directory name, be SURE to include\n#the double backslash at the end.

I want to learn microcontroller having speed greater than 16Mhz and can easily be interfaced with usb . So what type of microcontroller should i start learning and which book should you prefer for me having programming lesson and basic hardware startup for this type of microcontroller. Thanks</p>",

		"Title" : "In the case of rack equipment in data centers, we put the target port an...",
		"Body" : "<p>In the case of rack equipment in data centers, we put the target port and source port on every label - preferably in two lines.  It's reversed on the opposite end of the cable.  For example if I have a server CALPROD1 and I'm plugging into the iLo and on the other end I'm coming from switch CALSW035, blade 3, port 2, the labels would look like this...</p>\n\n<p>SERVER SIDE:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CALPROD1 /ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CALSW035 /3.2</strong></p>\n\n<p>SWITCH SIDE:</p>\n\n<p><strong>CALSW35 /3.2</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CALPROD1 /ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are several benefits to this.  Firstly, if service has to be performed and the cables need to be removed (like a chassis has to be pulled to replace a board or add memory, etc.) the engineer knows exactly where the cable came from and where to plug it back in.  From a tracing perspective, you know exactly where the this cable is going on the other end - patch panel, switch, another server, etc.  Sometimes we even put the cabinet info. Example: <strong>[A42] CALPROD1 / ilo</strong></p>\n\n<p>I merge all my labels from spreadsheet using the USB to a brother p-touch.  Their extra sticky labels are great in high-heat situations (like the back of servers) and their flexible ID tape is great for creating flags by wrapping cables.  If you use the \"regular\" labels in high heat, the lamination comes undone because it wants to return to flat while the white backer remains wrapped.</p>\n\n<p>When you have 40+ flags to put on, (often after you've already cabled stuff up), it's a real pain to get two sticky things to line up perfectly straight and without any creases or wrinkles.  The flags hardly ever come out like they look in the pictures.  <strong>IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A TRICK TO DOING FLAGS, PLEASE ADVISE!!!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd love to label parallel to the cable and then put a clear shrink sleeve over it but we cannot use anything like a heat gun or torch in a production data center.  Plus cables need to be unplugged in order to thread the sleeve.  Often times we're under a time crunch so cable dressing and labeling come after the system's spinning.</p>\n\n<p>Panduit flags are awesome to stick labels on (even the basic labels).  have to zip tie them but it's quick and easy to do even on active connections.  Cables are no longer \"snag less\" and Panduit tags cost more that the CAT5e cables themselves!  WTF?  Can't these be made overseas for practically free?</p>\n\n<p>Hope this is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Great discussion!  Thanks!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I wanted to comment but since i can't...</p>\n\n<p>Are you talking about the energy generation to produce fertilizer ? Then of course you can go non-fossil sources...you can use the sun the wind the water i think that if it is a closed environment you can even use the methane you generate to generate your own power</p>\n\n<p>But what you should ask yourself is do you really need industrialized fertilizer at all? Look to the nature plants have been there in abundance for a long time you can get all you need free from the nature.</p>\n\n<p>The overall fertility and viability of the soil, rather than the application of fertilizers as quick fixes, is at the very heart of organic gardening.</p>\n\n<p>Many organic materials serve as both fertilizers and soil conditioners\u2014they feed both soils and plants. This is one of the most important differences between a chemical approach and an organic approach toward soil care and fertilizing. Soluble chemical fertilizers contain mineral salts that plant roots can absorb quickly. However, these salts do not provide a food source for soil microorganisms and earthworms, and will even repel earthworms because they acidify the soil. Over time, soils treated only with synthetic chemical fertilizers lose organic matter and the all-important living organisms that help to build a quality soil. As soil structure declines and water-holding capacity diminishes, more and more of the chemical fertilizer applied will leach through the soil. In turn, it will take ever-increasing amounts of chemicals to stimulate plant growth. When you use organic fertilizers, you avoid throwing your soil into this kind of crisis condition.</p>\n\n<p>Use earthworms they are really good for the health of any soil and they are a free infinite fertilizer productor.</p>\n\n<p>Also you can try to plant a few spare leguminous plants on your farm because they take the nitrogen from air and put it on the ground avaible for other plant's to use if did right you won't  need to add nitrogen never again just le the nature do the job!</p>\n\n<p>I will stop here you can find much more about organics fertilizer and how to organic care not only your plants but your soil too on google</p>",

I'm using Volley, of course.</p>\n\n<pre><code>private List<ConversationsModel> conversationsList = new ArrayList<ConversationsModel>();\n\nConversationsRequest = MainPageActivity.instance().ConversationsRequest(ConversationURL, mPullToRefreshLayout);\n        MainController.getInstance().addToRequestQueue(ConversationsRequest);\n\n        conversationsList.clear();\n\n        ArrayList<HashMap<String, String>> lastMessages = db.getLastMessages(\"\");\n        PrettyTime p = new PrettyTime();\n\n        for (HashMap<String, String> map : lastMessages) {\n            SimpleDateFormat fmt = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n            Date date;\n\n            ConversationsModel convModel = new ConversationsModel();\n\n            try {\n                date = fmt.parse(map.get(\"vsenderdate\"));\n\n                convModel.setSenddate(p.format(date).toString());\n            } catch (ParseException e) {\n                // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n                e.printStackTrace();\n            }\n\n            convModel.setLasttext(map.get(\"vlasttext\"));\n            convModel.setNum(map.get(\"vphonenumber\"));\n            convModel.setThumbnailUrl(map.get(\"vprofilepic\"));\n            convModel.setUnread(Integer.parseInt(map.get(\"vunread\")));\n            convModel.setUsernameornumber(map.get(\"vcontact\"));\n            convModel.setUniqueid(map.get(\"vuniqueid\"));\n\n            if (map.get(\"vuniqueid\").equals(\"0\")) {\n                convModel.setIsgroup(0);\n            } else {\n                convModel.setIsgroup(1);\n            }\n\n            conversationsList.add(convModel);\n\n            adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();\n        }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>php side is simple json</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\"contact\":{\"name\":\"+xxx xxx xxx xxx\"},\"contact_image\":\"image.png\",\"uniqueid\":\"0\",\"num\":\"xxx xxx xxx\",\"lasttext\":\"text goes here...\",\"lastdate\":\"2015-01-21 12:13:59\",\"unread\":0}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I do not want examples how to code. This is simple model that runs inside thread with 30 seconds interval, gets json data, then I clear sQlite database and insert new rows, at least application reads from sQlite database.</p>\n\n<p>When I saw that it was very simple, slow and ugly solution, I made Crontab that retrieves same json data from mysql and stores in .json file. I read data from json file, not directly from database. I became faster, but still killing application.</p>\n\n<p>now I'm going to create some simple web server in C++, that connect to xxx port and gets data. But I think it is not better solution at all. Is there better solution? Should I get data in bytes to make faster or what can I do to application, to exchange data faster between client and server.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>",

Unfortunately, I'm self teaching (I have no professor to ask) and I'm afraid there's no solution companion for Durbin and Koopman (2012)!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199641178.001.0001/acprof-9780199641178-chapter-2?rskey=FZDLQi&result=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exercise 2.13.1 from Time Series Analysis by State Space Methods Second Edition</a></strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Consider the local level model (2.3).</p>\n  \n  <p>(a) Give the model representation for $x_t = y_t - y_{t-1}$, for $t = 2, ..., n$.</p>\n  \n  <p>(b) Show that the model for $x_t$ in (a) can have the same statistical properties as the model given by $x_t = \\epsilon_t + \\theta \\epsilon_{t-1}$ where $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)$, .......</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the record, the local level model (2.3) is given by:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$y_t = \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t \\quad\\quad \\epsilon_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2)$</p>\n  \n  <p>$\\alpha_{t+1} = \\alpha_t + \\eta_t \\quad\\quad \\eta_t \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\eta}^2)$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Doubts about (a)</strong></p>\n\n<p>First of all, the model proposed in (a) looks like noise (which makes perfect sense since it's the first difference of a random walk). Is the following representation correct?</p>\n\n<p>$$ x_t = y_t - y_{t-1} = \\alpha_t + \\epsilon_t - \\alpha_{t-1} - \\epsilon_{t-1} $$\n$$ x_t = \\alpha_{t-1} + \\eta_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t - \\alpha_{t-1} - \\epsilon_{t-1} $$\n$$ x_t = \\eta_{t-1} + \\epsilon_{t} - \\epsilon_{t-1}  $$</p>\n\n<p>This makes me doubt. First, state disturbance $\\eta_{t-1}$ is now part of the observation equation. Second, what does the state equation mean now that the observation equation doesn't relate to the unobserved states $\\alpha_t$? Third, and somehow related, what's the mean unobserved state now that $\\alpha_t$ isn't anymore on the formula? Zero?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Doubts about (b)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Additionaly, I wonder how to show that models have the same statistical properties. What do you have to prove to say they're the same? Same expected value and variance of observation $x_t$, unobserved state $\\alpha_t$, prediction error $v_t = x_t - a_t $, filtered unobserved state, updated unobserved state, etc.? Since all random variables are Normal, I guess showing the first two moments match is enough, but a) what distribution (marginal, conditionals, conditionals on what?) of b) what variables (observed, hidden state, prediction error, etc.) should be equal?</p>\n\n<p>Any comment is much appreciated!</p>",

If there is a simpler way, I am sure you will let me know.</p>\n\n<p>In theory these steps should work for any linux distribution, you just need to find the original configure options that are used to compile apache for your distro. Perhaps you could add comments to this answer on where you found the options.</p>\n\n<p>The important option is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>--enable-layout=Debian</code></pre>\n\n<p>Debian can be changed to any one of the supported layouts in config.layout file in the apache build directory, the options are defined as:</p>\n\n<pre><code><Layout x>\n...\n</Layout></code></pre>\n\n<p>Where x would be the layout option. Try googling \"--enable-layout=x\" where x is your distribution to find your options. Try find the original options used by your distro and not some random suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: As mentioned by faker the problem with this is that when you upgrade using apt and there is a new version of apache2, the compiled version will be overwritten. His suggestion of building a new deb is a good one. Unfortunately due to various deb dependency issues that are too much work to get around I have not been able to do so. However I would suggest that you try that route first, this should help you:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.wpkg.org/2014/06/29/building-apache-2-4-x-deb-packages-for-debian-wheezy-7-x/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.wpkg.org/2014/06/29/building-apache-2-4-x-deb-packages-for-debian-wheezy-7-x/</a></p>\n\n<p>I've opted to keep it as is, however I have set a hold on apache2 so it is not upgraded till I am ready to release the hold. Alternatively you could just remove apache from the machine and add it again when you are ready.</p>\n\n<p>To hold:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-mark hold apache2</code></pre>\n\n<p>To release hold:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo apt-mark unhold apache2</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would also suggest that you make a clone of the server you wish to change, work through the process on the clone and get it working before trying it on a production env. Breaking apache for a day or longer on a prod environment is not a stress you need in your life. This is where virtual machines are great, take a snapshot and create a new instance from the snapshot.

I have data array consisting of such data in large size. Now I want scrollable graph containing plot of such time and value data. Here is my javascript implementation to do so,</p>\n\n<pre><code>var dataArray; //This contains my data array i.e. ([[t1, v1],[t2, v2],...])\n\nvar minDate = dataArray[0][0];\nvar maxDate = dataArray[dataArray.length - 1][0];\n\nvar chartOption = {\n        chart: {\n            type: graphType,\n            renderTo: 'graph-container',\n            zoomType: 'x',\n            useUTC: false\n        },\n        title: {\n            text: 'Data from last 24 hours'\n        },\n        credits : {\n            enabled: false\n        },\n        xAxis: {\n            title: {\n                text: null\n            },\n            type: 'datetime',\n            dateTimeLabelFormats: {\n                second: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M:%S',\n                minute: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M',\n                hour: '%Y-%m-%d<br/>%H:%M',\n                day: '%Y<br/>%m-%d',\n                week: '%Y<br/>%m-%d',\n                month: '%Y-%m',\n                year: '%Y'\n            },\n            allowDecimals: false,\n            ordinal: false,\n            min: minDate,\n            max: maxDate\n        },\n        yAxis: {\n            title: {\n                text: null\n            }\n        },\n        plotOptions: {\n            series: {\n                pointStart: minDate,\n                pointInterval: 5 * 60 *1000\n            }\n        },\n        series: [{\n            name: parameterName,\n            data: dataArray\n        }],\n        exporting: {\n            enabled: false\n        }\n    };\n\n    parameterChart = new Highcharts.Chart(chartOption);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The chart shows incorrect data, the time value on x-axis doesn't match the value at y-axis.

		"Body" : "<p>I've been experiencing massive slowdown on my server after launching a new website.</p>\n\n<p>Using MONyog I can see that after an apache/mysql restart, the queries/second starts out nice and low for around 10 minutes, but then creeps up to a rate at which the server massively slows down with some queries hanging for 10 seconds or more.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mojZw.png\" alt=\"MONyog Monitoring Screenshot\"></p>\n\n<p>Through my research I think what is happening is that there are some inefficient queries that cause the creation of some temporary tables on disk, which piles up and reaches the server limits over time and grinds to a hault.</p>\n\n<p>Working my way through the worst offenders I have managed to optimize a lot of queries with the help of some Googling, but my knowledge of optimizing MySQL is very limited and I'm stuck on this particular one that I'm not sure what to do with.</p>\n\n<p>The following is the last slow query in the list, it queries 2 databases; <code>bl_post</code> and <code>cp_data</code>. <code>cp_data</code> is relational. <code>table11.cpda_meta_val</code> holds the published date

The problem is that I'm using pooled data across multiple experiments (not conducted by me). The experiments involve different methodologies and have introduced an un-quantified error into the measurements of CA. So, for example, even if the response to P,T,S in CA is similar across studies the values of CA might be offset between studies because of different amounts of contamination.</p>\n\n<p>How do I account for this error (which is actually lab-based contamination) in the multiple regression model? Would adding the study/experiment as a categorical predictor variable help? Or is there another way?</p>\n\n<p>(Note, I'm not a statistician and am not familiar with the symbology that is often used on this forum...)</p>\n\n<p>Update: After some searching I'm starting to think a Random Effects Model (i.e. Proc TSCSREG is SAS) might be appropriate? Any advice would be great...</p>\n\n<p>Many thanks.</p>",

It would be the way to gain maximum control and AFAIK this is required for repeated events that you want to transfer via e.g. <code>org-caldav.el</code>.  The reason is that you need an UID (<em>U</em>nique) for each event to be able to consistently track them (though <code>ox-ical.el</code> does provide such an UID for repeated events set up with e.g. <code>org-class</code> they are ignored by at least <code>org-caldav.el</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, <code>org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift</code> has been part of Emacs for a good many years.

		"Body" : "<p>Suppose I have a number of random variables $X,Y,\\ldots$, and we can assume the joint distribution of these variables is known in advance. I also have an unknown function $f(x,y,\\ldots)$ with corresponding input parameters. The values of $f()$ are obtained by experiment, and we can assume that $f()$ is repeatable (so if I repeat the experiment with the same inputs I get the same answer).</p>\n\n<p>I then take $N$ samples from the random variables, and for each sample $x_i,y_i,\\ldots$ obtain (from an experiment) observations $f_i=f(x_i,y_i,\\ldots)$. I then use least squares regression to estimate a polynomial approximation $\\hat{f}$ to $f$ based on the sample data and observations.</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of well established tests for assessing the goodness of fit/estimation error of $\\hat{f}$ and obtaining the covariances of the polynomial coefficients.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows. The random variables $X,Y,\\ldots$ and $\\hat{f}$ are used to estimate a new quantity, $\\hat{Q}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ which is a test statistic of the distribution of $\\hat{f}(X,Y,\\ldots)$ (in fact it is a quantile).</p>\n\n<p>If I had chosen different samples $x_i,y_i,\\ldots$ then I'd end up with a different $\\hat{f}$ and a different $\\hat{Q}$. I would like to calculate the possible effect of estimation error on $\\hat{Q}$ from the uncertainty in estimating the coefficients. </p>\n\n<p>Is this problem as simple as follows? Suppose $\\hat{f}(x,y,\\ldots)=\\hat{\\beta_0}+\\hat{\\beta_1}\\cdot x+\\hat{\\beta_2}\\cdot y+\\hat{\\beta_3}\\cdot xy+\\beta_4 \\cdot x^2+\\cdots$ are the polynomial coefficients. I assume that</p>\n\n<p>$\\beta_i\\sim N(\\hat{\\beta_i},\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2)$</p>\n\n<p>where $\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2$ are the sample covariances from my linear model fit and then I have</p>\n\n<p>$Q\\sim N(\\hat{Q},\\sum\\frac{\\partial\\hat{Q}}{\\partial\\beta_i}\\cdot\\hat{\\sigma_i}^2)$</p>\n\n<p>where the sum is taken over all coefficients of linear terms (so ignoring higher order terms in $\\hat{f}$ like $\\beta_3,\\beta_4$). Happily I know $\\partial\\hat{Q}/\\partial\\beta_i$. Hence a confidence interval.</p>\n\n<p>Is this correct? I'm concerned about ignoring the higher order terms in $\\hat{f}$. Are there alternative approaches eg. bootstrapping? or some references you can point me to?</p>",

However, none of these values map to anything that looks like a neatline area of the image, and some of them are beyond the width and height bounds of the image.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If I understand correctly, it should be possible to apply some simple linear function to a set of coordinates to convert them into pixel values using the image's GeoTransform metadata.</strong>  MapToPixel should be providing such a transformation.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.  I can also settle for hearing about GDAL utilities that could crop the image using NEATLINE without warping or rotating it (somehow preventing gdalwarp from doing this or using a different utility altogether).</p>",

It worked for me on an earlier beta release of commerce-kickstart.</p>\n\n<p>So, what I did:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Created three different flat rate shipping services.</li>\n<li>Created a calculation rule.</li>\n<li>First condition: data comparison (Data to compare: [commerce-line-item:type], Data value: Shipping)</li>\n<li>Second condition: entity has field (Entity: [commerce-line-item:order], Field: commerce_customer_shipping)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now I should be able to use \"Order address component comparison\", but it doesn't work.\nI can dpm in actions for the shipping-line-item and can see the country-code, but I don't find a way to get it compared.</p>\n\n<p>I tried it with \"data comparison\" rule, but it seems, I can't get deep enough in the array to get the correct field. I can dpm this: <code>commerce-line-item:order:commerce-customer-shipping</code>, and I see the country code here: <code>->commerce_customer_address['en'][0]['country']</code>, but I don't find a way to use it for comparison.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there is an easy solution with executing custom php code in rules to compare the countries?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Maybe the problem has to do with field translation. The customer profile types billing and shipping information have field translation on. I tried to disable translation, but after next test order it was enabled again.</p>\n\n<p>Then I checked the database fields for address management and found something strange. In field_data_commerce_customer_address table the language is 'en', but in field_data_commerce_customer_billing and -shipping it is 'und'.</p>\n\n<p>If I switch page language to english, the checkout finishes without error.\nIf site language is german, the addresses are not shown on checkouts review page, and on complete page I get errors from presave function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Undefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 522 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 523 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nInvalid argument supplied for foreach() in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 532 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 522 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nUndefined index: und in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 523 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\nInvalid argument supplied for foreach() in commerce_order_commerce_customer_profile_presave() (Zeile 532 von /drupal-commerce/profiles/commerce_kickstart/modules/contrib/commerce/modules/order/commerce_order.module)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can someone help me with that?

		"Body" : "<p>You have to differ two things:</p>\n\n<p><strong>A)</strong> The hash function as a function to transform a given set of information input to a well defined set of output. If you look at this aspect of a hashing function, it has to solve two problems:</p>\n\n<p>1) It should be designed to avoid collisions - it would be a mess, if you have a high collision rate because it would be easier to \"guess\" the password. Think of a  function which sums up every ASCII-Position of every char input: the <em>outcome</em> for \u00BBab\u00AB is the same as for \u00BBba\u00AB. So this would be really a very bad choice.</p>\n\n<p>2) It should be deterministic so that you could reproduce the result. \nHashes are used for comparison. So it should be clear, that a function, which has no deterministic output is useless.</p>\n\n<p><strong>B)</strong> The use of a hashing-algorithm in the context of storing passwords in a database. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is hashing safe if a given string always generates the same hash?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From (A) it is clear, that, since the output is deterministic a possible attack vector would be to use premade/-calculated hashes aka <em>Rainbow-Tables</em>. </p>\n\n<p><em>simple example:</em></p>\n\n<p>Say, your password is \"hello world\". The <em>MD5</em>-Sum is: <em>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em>. \nGoogling (our \u00BB<em>Rainbow table</em>\u00AB for the sake of the example) for that checksum leads you to <a href=\"http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/lookaside/extras/koji/hello/6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> location, where you find a file, whose content is \"hello world\". So simply hashing isn't enough. A way to improve security is to use a salt (which could be stored alongside the hash). In our case, let's add <em>6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em> (the <em>MD5</em>-sum of the previous example) to the passphrase => \u00BB<em>hello world6f5902ac237024bdd0c176cb93063dc4</em>\u00AB. The new MD5 is <em>f59c64e092edb4fbc2904a3b28ce88c5</em>. If you google that, you have no results. </p>\n\n<p>Beware: I am not(!) suggesting, using <em>MD5</em> in this way is in any way \"<em>secure</em>\" - but I used it to exemplify how a salt affects the outcome of a hashing function. Although the hash is calculated deterministically, the output for one password and two different salts is different enough to make the \"<em>guessing</em>\"-part a bit harder.</p>",

		"Title" : "Your question is quite unclear. On the wall, there are multiple classes ...",
		"Body" : "<p>Your question is quite unclear. On the wall, there are multiple classes of brothers:\n1-Kind of civilians: Builders, cooks, maesters and assistants. This kind of brothers is not deemed fit to train for arms, and most of the cases, the masters in arms<br>\n2-Soldiers : This is the most common type of brothers on the wall, they are trained to wield a sword and perhaps use a bow and arrow. Their day to day tasks are to mount gards on the wall and engage enemy in defense of the wall.\nNB: the first and second category are very close, and their tasks may be confused, and some sources mention that :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Every man in the Watch walks the wall, and all are expected to bare steel in its defense, but the rangers are the true fighting men of the Watch (I: 372)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However we never heard of Sam Tarly walking the wall. So...</p>\n\n<p>3-Rangers: These are the gifted unfortunate, that have joined the wall for one reason or another. They're hence given the toughest quests. Rangers often dwell behind the wall, and seldom on it. They are generally good trackers and stealth masters. They know very well their way in the land of the far north. Qhorin Halfhand and Benjen Stark are very known rangers.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the armour now that is the core of your question. The first category doesn't require one, so what they wear around is what keeps them warmest, so any kind of animal fur or skin or leather would do.(I am not taking into consideration the latest events on the wall were resources were scarce and everybody engaged in battle).\nRecruits of the Watch wear often </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>roughspun black (I: 149)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>because such described wear is hard to get by and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns (I: 150)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The second category, is the one destined more for battle. However, they prefer boiled leather to any other protection. The main reason behind that is that steel is cold, and gets colder with the cold of the north, can even cause problems during long watches. \nThe third category, is the rangers'. Well this category even though it seems to be the most danger exposed one, is the least worried about protection, for several reasons. If they go detected on their reckon missions, no kind of armour would save them. If they stay exposed in the cold with heavy armour, they'd die of cold. So they prefer skin. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rangers often share skins for warmth (III: 169)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OJkKM.jpg\" alt=\"Qhorin Halfhand by Matt Olson\"></p>\n\n<p>Oh, and of course, all these categories have cloaks of course, black washed out cloaks. \nAnd before I end my answer (which cannot really be considered as answer for lack of details about the question) I have to add that in order to answer this question properly, we need to study the armour of the free folks. They're more exposed to war than the black watch, and they're accustomed to war in cold. Some have bones for armour, some boiled leather, and whatever armour the brothers of the watch use, is either stolen from free folks (it goes the other way around also) either inspired by them. After all, a seasoned brother of the night watch, is very similar to any one of the free folk, I guess the circumstances change a person.</p>\n\n<p>PS: I heavily relied in this answer on this excellent <a href=\"http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Concordance/Section/3.3./\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Several resources around the net (apologies for not having links handy) recommend to determine the total amount of available physical memory on a Linux system by the second value on the \"-/+ buffers/cache\" line in the output of <code>free</code>, with the explanation that buffers and cache may be discarded immediately if a process tries to allocate more memory than is unused at the time (\"Mem:\" line of <code>free</code>). I've found this statement to be consistently empirically wrong, meaning allocating more memory than is \"unused\" fails frequently.</p>\n\n<p>Researching about this, I've found the \"MemAvailable:\" line in <code>/proc/meminfo</code>, and <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/7/264\" rel=\"nofollow\">this explanation</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Subject: provide estimated available memory in /proc/meminfo\n\nMany load balancing and workload placing programs check /proc/meminfo\nto estimate how much free memory is available. They generally do this\nby adding up \"free\" and \"cached\", which was fine ten years ago, but\nis pretty much guaranteed to be wrong today.\n\nIt is wrong because Cached includes memory that is not freeable as\npage cache, for example shared memory segments, tmpfs, and ramfs,\nand it does not include reclaimable slab memory, which can take up\na large fraction of system memory on mostly idle systems with lots\nof files.\n\nCurrently, the amount of memory that is available for a new workload,\nwithout pushing the system into swap, can be estimated from MemFree,\nActive(file), Inactive(file), and SReclaimable, as well as the \"low\"\nwatermarks from /proc/zoneinfo.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is that the system available for me to run my programs on has a 3.2.0 kernel which apparently does not provide \"MemAvailable\".</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong> How can I (approximately) compute the amount of available physical memory myself, using that memory information that is available to me?</p>\n\n<pre><code>MemTotal:       16536344 kB\nMemFree:         8615224 kB\nBuffers:          241896 kB\nCached:          1341944 kB\nSwapCached:       100232 kB\nActive:          5320768 kB\nInactive:        2021312 kB\nActive(anon):    4298508 kB\nInactive(anon):  1483164 kB\nActive(file):    1022260 kB\nInactive(file):   538148 kB\nUnevictable:          32 kB\nMlocked:              32 kB\nSwapTotal:       9918460 kB\nSwapFree:        7730432 kB\nDirty:                56 kB\nWriteback:             0 kB\nAnonPages:       5720696 kB\nMapped:           103628 kB\nShmem:             23432 kB\nSlab:             432516 kB\nSReclaimable:     356780 kB\nSUnreclaim:        75736 kB\nKernelStack:        7320 kB\nPageTables:        69764 kB\nNFS_Unstable:          0 kB\nBounce:                0 kB\nWritebackTmp:          0 kB\nCommitLimit:    18186632 kB\nCommitted_AS:   12325296 kB\nVmallocTotal:   34359738367 kB\nVmallocUsed:      120924 kB\nVmallocChunk:   34351227352 kB\nHardwareCorrupted:     0 kB\nAnonHugePages:         0 kB\nHugePages_Total:       0\nHugePages_Free:        0\nHugePages_Rsvd:        0\nHugePages_Surp:        0\nHugepagesize:       2048 kB\nDirectMap4k:      103240 kB\nDirectMap2M:    16738304 kB\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>PS: I realize the actual computation is detailed in the kernel patch I linked to, but I'm having a hard time relating this to the output that is available to me.</p>",

		"Title" : "What is the best way to track the authenticated user on the server side?",
		"Body" : "<p>For a web app, the client side is javascript in the browser. The server side is ASP.NET with a REST API. At present there is a single server but we plan to scale out with a server each in the US, UK, and AUS (on Azure). We'll have redis (but that does not sync up instantaneously). They will (almost) always be using SSL.</p>\n\n<p>When a user logs in, we authenticate them. It's easy to pass back the primary key of that user record in the DB and on subsequent calls in, pass that PK to identify the user. It's also trivially easy to then impersonate any user.</p>\n\n<p>What's the best way to implement this? The two things I have thought of are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Return a guid and require that guid on all subsequent calls.</li>\n<li>Store the PK in the Session data on the server side and use that to identify the user on all subsequent calls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both of the above work if an existing session continues to go to the same server (which I believe it does) for each subsequent request.</p>\n\n<p>So, what's the best way to do this? Either of the above two? Or is there another approach that's better?</p>\n\n<p>thanks - dave</p>",

It provides a character-user-interface, so it can be launched remotely, within a simple SSH connection (no web, no big GUI libraries, etc.);</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.ntop.org/products/ntop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NTOP</a>:  from the official website: \"<em>...a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does...</em>\". NTOP is way much feature-rich than IPTRAF. Definitely more powerful (but more complex to configure/install than a single \"<em>apt-get install</em>\" or \"<em>yum install</em>\")</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As clearly stated, both tools above provides good <strong>REAL-TIME</strong> data (as you asked in your question). Anyway, I'm quite confident that you need <em><strong>ALSO</strong></em> asynchronous data: I'm sure you want also to be able to check something like: \"<em>who were the hosts/MACs that generated/consumed most of the traffic, yesterday? And for which protocols?</em>\", probably drilling down such data back to a single IP/MAC/PORT, and down to a granularity of.... 1 minute. Don't you? In such a case I strongly reccomend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://pmacct.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PMACCT</a>: from the official website: \"<em>...pmacct is a small set of passive network monitoring tools to measure, account, classify, aggregate and export IPv4 and IPv6 traffic..</em>\". Please note that PMACCT can solve a wide range of problems, most of them suited for big/large ISP/operators. Nevertheless, it can run perfectly of your linux-box and account for traffic flowing along its interfaces. With a configuration like this:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>-</p>\n\n<pre><code>host:~# cat /etc/pmacct/pmacctd.conf\n\ninterface: eth0\ndaemonize: true\naggregate: src_mac,dst_mac,src_host,dst_host,proto,src_port,dst_port\n\nports_file: /etc/pmacct/ports.list \n\nplugins: mysql\n\nsql_user: pmacct\nsql_passwd: sqlpassword\nsql_db: pmacct\nsql_table: acct_v4_%Y_%m_%d\n[...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it can easily keep track of traffic flowing along eth0 in a mysql table, so for you to easily check what happened on your network with a common/simple SQL-query.</p>\n\n<p>Just to give you some real numbers, I've succesfully used PMACCT on a server with a XEON X3350; 4GB of RAM; 4 broadcom GigaEth interfaces; nearly 70 VLANs configured on eth0 and pmacct listening on all of them; +/- 300GB of various IP traffic routed on a daily basis; PMACCT generating accounting EVERY_MINUTE, for EVERY_VLAN, for EVERY tuple (src_mac, dst_mac, src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, dst_port); +/- 60.000.000 accounting records per day. \nAll of this, without any issue (but writing on text-files, not in MySQL). In smaller environments, anyway, there are no problems in writing directly to MySQL.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please note that thanks to PMACCT I keep track of <em>EACH</em> IP addresses seen on my networks, on a daily basis (in other words: I know that 10.29.19.89 have not been seen since july 16th 2014; 172.17.1.45 have never been seen [since the start of PMACCT accounting]; etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Also on PMACCT: I have configured the ethernet switch connecting my main Internet-gateway, to \"mirror\" its traffic to a free port, where I've plugged an ad-hoc linux-box accounting all the Internet traffic (a 1GEth link). No issue at all.</p>\n\n<p>A final note about PMACCT: should you (or some other readers) wonder why I <strong>NOT</strong> choosed some more common NETFLOW/IPFIX probe/collector, the reason is very simple: PMACCT is the only one I've found being able to account also MAC-addresses.</p>",

Then, is a \"shemitah year\" the 7th year of a \"shemitah\" or is it\nthe 8th year - e.g. the first year AFTER a \"shemitah\"?  I thought a \"shemitah year\" is the 7th year- e.g. Sept./13 to Sept./14.

		"Title" : "Video continuously pausing when home streamed to iPhone with Bluetooth headphones",
		"Body" : "<p>I have my itunes library on home sharing to share my movie collection across my devices so I can watch either on my iPhone or apple tv. Streaming to my apple tv is perfect but streaming to my iPhone is buggy. I recently bought a new pair of blue tooth headphones to get rid the wires and they work great for listeing to music on home streaming but when I try stream movies from my pc to my iPhone using my headphones the video will play for +- 30 seconds, then pause and wait for what feels like minutes on end. Then it will play again for 30 seconds and pause. It seemed like a streaming issue but if I plug in the supplied cable for the headphones and don't use the bluetooth it streams fine for most movies. If it's a long movie(2.5hrs+) that is large file then even that will battle to stream to my iphone with bluetooth off. TV series episodes stream fine with no hesitation.</p>\n\n<p>I have searched the net for answers but nothing comes up relating specifically to my issue or anyway to solve it. I have reset modem, phone, pc logged in and out of home sharing, nothing seems to fix the issue. </p>\n\n<p>Putting the movies on my phone is also not an option because I don't have the space available even if I took all the apps and data off I would have enough space for maybe 1 or 2 movies. I only have a 16gb iPhone 5C</p>\n\n<p>All streaming is from windows 7 PC with iTunes 12. I have tried 2 different routers thinking that maybe the issue but also no luck</p>\n\n<p>I hope someone can come back with an answer</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2015-01-21</strong></p>\n\n<p>So after some more testing with different videos it seems the issue is a large bitrate file of 19000Kbps+ will not stream to my iphone if my bluetooth headphones are connected. The other videos I have now are all around 10000Kbps range and they work. I cannot confirm what is the max Kbps rate at which streaming and bluetooth headphones will not work but 19000kbps is too large.  </p>\n\n<p>Also My router doesn't have the ability to switch wifi to 5Ghz so I can't confirm if this would stop the \"interference\" between the headphones and wifi signal.</p>\n\n<p>I'll update in a few days with more findings after I do some more testing.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I have been running a LAMP stack on Debian for a couple of years for a medium sized .com.  A couple of advantages that I have found in Debian is the superb package manager, aptitude.  You can install and update the software via packages, which makes it less of a hassle to be running the latest, most secure version of the software.  Also, a huge advantage is that the stability of the Debian platform is nearly unmatched by even other flavors of linux, thanks to the Debian dev team's insistence on never releasing until the software is ready.  Finally, there is the great way in which they implemented apache2.  This seems trivial, but there are a2en a2dis utilities that allow for easily adding and removing modules and virtualhosts.<br>\nYou'll find most of these advantages in Ubuntu, but I've experienced issues in upgrading the OS to the next version that I don't run into when using Debian proper.</p>",

I want to add a custom module in the <code>modules</code>, but when doing so I encountered problems.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I cannot find anything like \"master configuration\" project type, which by default would contain the <code>manifests</code> and <code>modules</code> folders. So I created a bare \"Puppet project\" project, and created the folders manually. </p>\n\n<p>Because - as I understand it - in this configuration Gepetto doesn't really know, that this project will actually hold all the modules, it doesn't provide an option to create \"Puppet module project\" <strong>subproject</strong>, which would be nested inside the \"Puppet project\"'s <code>modules</code> folder.</p>\n\n<p>When I nest it manually (by specifying a custom location in the <code>New Puppet Module Project</code> wizard), I get an <code>'Auto share git projects' has encountered a problem</code> error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unable to ignore resources\n  Attempted to beginRule: F/puppet@puppetmaster/modules/unnamed, does not match outer scope rule: MultiRule[P/mymodule]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did anyone of you managed to get Gepetto working with modules when everything is covered by something like \"master project\" that encapsulates all configuration? </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>As I am a non native speaker I appologize for the indulgence of giving my 2 cents and I warn that my grammatical understanding might be tinted by german synthax. But i think that I am able to help, or atleast point in the right direction. As it was already mentioned you would have to change \"has led\" to \"have led\" in your original quote if you would apply \"and\" instead of \"together with\" and i believe this to be the main issue here. Together with is no \"Linker\", it is a preposition which normally</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"My work ethic <em>and</em> belief in my ability <em>have</em> led to progress.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is simply because \"and\" links 2 noun phrases together as the <em>subject</em> of your sentence. It is both, your work ethic AND your belief which led to progress. But still it would be more conventional to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"my work ethic(,) together with (my) belief in my ability(,) <em>has</em> led to progress.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, why is that? Quite simple; \"Together\" is an adverb. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We did this together. How have we done this? together</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, i am equal how not a big fan of \"together with\" as it seems awkward. but:\n\"together with\" is no linker. It is a preposition which normally introduces an adverbial phrase. It does not answer the question who is doing something but rather \"how\", \"through what\" or \"wherewith/whomwith\" something is done. As in \"YOU ran a marathon together with 1000 other athlets\". Using \"together with\" in your example would give your work ethics an outstanding role in coomparison to your self-belief, which would only have the sidekick. A perfect example to explain the difference of \"together with\" and \"and\" would be the following example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"the woman passes a man(,) together with some kids\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"the woman passes a man and some kids\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Atleast i would udnerstand these two sentences differently; in the first sentence it is not the man who is together with \"some kids\" but the women who passes him (though i am unsure about the requirement  of a comma). to clarify that the man is standing there with some kids you would have to say;</p>\n  \n  <p>\"the woman passes a man, <em>who is</em> together with some kids\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Your believe in your ability becomes a tool rather then an actor should you use \"together with\". let's restructure your sentence to illustrate what this means: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Together with my/the belief in my ability, my work ethic has led to progress\"</p>\n  \n  <p>or more clumsy: </p>\n  \n  <p>\"My work ethic has led to progress, together with my believe in my ability\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's have a look at some more examples to clarify what i mean</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>He <em>is</em> playing (together) with his friends</p>\n    \n    <p>He and his friends <em>are</em> playing (alone in their homes) </p>\n    \n    <p>He and his friends are playing together</p>\n  </blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the same goes for \"along with\".

		"Body" : "<p>If you are simply looking for an answer as to why your balance wasn't decreasing, the answer is that your logic was incorrect.</p>\n\n<pre><code>newBalance = (balance - minPay) + (balance * rate);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Should be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>newBalance = balance + (balance * rate) - minPay ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You want to add the interest to the current balance, and then subtract whatever the minimum payment is.

For example, you shouldn't instantiate a new instance of the class every loop. Instead, continue to use the same class instance. You should also check to see if the balance is 0, for example the output I got from running your program allowed me to pay into the negatives.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps, feel free to ask questions if it doesn't make sense.</p>",

While the above info is good to know, I've already spent a couple hours experimenting with my on-board equipment and settings (Windows 7, motherboard sound card) and I think at this point, the easiest and most foolproof solution for me is to buy an ASIO-supported sound card. I guess I didn't realize what a technical and niche area this is, since even searches I'm doing aren't turning back much info on a relatively low cost, ASIO supported card, which (I think) is all I need. Does anyone have some product recs? Am I way off base about all this? I come from the music side, not the computer side, and really my goal is to get up and running ASAP. Thanks</p>",

I found that in addition to the default.aspx for the app, there is also a built-in \"viewer.aspx\" which has no navigation bar at the top of the app. My workaround was to change the link to my Access App from the top-level site, so that it goes to the viewer.aspx instead of default.aspx. This way there is no direct link to the subsite, and no \"Back to Site\" link for people to click on and get confused. I also turned on the top-level site's Publishing so that I could make my links open in new tabs, so that my users don't have to click back a bunch of times to get back to the top-level site. For my situation, this was the best solution to the problem. I hope that this answer will help others who have a similar struggle where they need unique permissions (and therefore subsites), but also desire unique navigation.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\n~Sydney</p>",

As stated earlier, Sludge has trace amounts of metals in it, being that it comes from mining coal, and being that coal is under ground, where we find metal, it is possible to convert coal sludge in to gold. More difficult than just straight up metal, since you can never tell how much metal is in the sludge without a proper examination, which Ed never did. Again, this is all based on the manga, being that it was the original story and ultimate source if you can't consult the author. I hope this cleared it up at least a bit, thanks for reading.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I had this error, and now I have discovered the source of the problem. I had a hard time finding out, so maybe this will be useful to someone, even though I realize, my problem and workaround may not be spot on matching op's original trouble.</p>\n\n<p>I am migrating data from MSSQL to MySQL, and the content being migrated is html-content from Sitecore CMS (target CMS is Drupal, btw).</p>\n\n<p>I've found, that I get this error when converting the database and hitting records, that contain <strong>Instagram-embeds</strong>. Instagram-embeds work in the way, that the embedded post data is copied to the embed code (instead of being loaded async., et.c. - even the image is included as base64-css...), and the young people nowadays tend to put a lot of emoji's in their image-descriptions (using their iPhones with Emoji keyboard). Emoji's are represented by 4-byte encoded characters, but MySQL <code>utf8</code> only allows for 3-byte encoded unicode characters.</p>\n\n<p>My initial error from running <code>wbcopytables.exe</code> (which is the non-GUI way of doing Migration Wizard in MySQL Workbench) was the</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Error during charset conversion of wstring: No error</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but upgrading MySQL Workbench to recent version (from <em>5.something</em> to <em>6.x</em>) makes the error a bit more descriptive, hinting table and column (alas, not row):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ERROR: Could not successfully convert UCS-2 string to UTF-8 in table\n  [MyDatabase].[dbo].[MyTable] (column MyColumn).\n  Original string: ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyway - a solution *could* be to use <code>utf8mb4</code> which would allow for the emoji's. Read more <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10957238/incorrect-string-value-when-trying-to-insert-utf-8-into-mysql-via-jdbc\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But it looks like, it's <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1314214\" rel=\"nofollow\">a bad idea</a> to do this in e.g. my case with Drupal. </p>\n\n<p>So - the solution I ended up with was simply to strip these characters in my migrate-script. There is no point in keeping these for users of the site in question, since they are being displayed as rectangles on the webpage anyway. Script happens to be c# .NET, and I found the help <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28023682/how-do-i-remove-emoji-characters-from-a-string\">here</a> (thanks a ton, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet\">Jon Skeet</a>) - turns out there is a regex-pattern for matching one half of a surrogate pair in UTF-16. See below (and use the pattern in another language if needed).</p>\n\n<pre><code>var emojiStripped = Regex.Replace(stringWithEmojis, @\"\\p{Cs}\", string.Empty);\n</code></pre>",

BUT... nothing ever appears in the Inbox.   AND, it DOES succeed in loading the many sub-folders within the mail account that I have configured in yahoo... AND, if I click on one of those, then after 20 seconds, it loads the folder's contents fine. AND, when I SEND mail, it sends out just fine.  But nothing in the normal, plain Inbox!</p>\n\n<p>I have created it several times. Once I even tried to force it to allow me to \"manually\" create the inbox without it sniffing that it was a yahoo account and applying the official yahoo settings it knows. I did that by initially putting extra false characters in the yahoo domain name, and then setting up all the IMAP and SMTP stuff manually, and then changing the initial domain name entry to remove the wrong characters.  But the results were exactly the same -- empty inbox.</p>\n\n<p>AND, when I have yahoo set up in the normal way (but not working right...)  and I go to the Connection Doctor... it scans through and gives the green-light indicator saying that IMAP and SMTP are working fine!</p>\n\n<p>Any info, tips, or similar issues with Yahoo Mail and the mail.app in Yosemite?</p>\n\n<p>THANKS -- Eric</p>",

OK oh shit here are these terrible gnome VNC grey screens again .. digging digging through Gnome forums (other vnc servers run happily Linux Mint) then I noted I need to set Vino params over SSH - got \"Cannot autolaunch D-Bus without X11 $DISPLAY\" (I DONT HAVE A DESKTOP!!!), tried the DBUS shell script - that of course doesnt work, then found out (while vnc is already running and I have a 'Display') , I can issue:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DISPLAY=:1 gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>yes that executes without an error\n(display number is your vnc desktop number)\nbut still that shit grey screen in the vnc terminal...</p>\n\n<p>So again, January 2015, the setting of variables through SSH so that a VNC client will efficiently work on GNOME is still a disaster and the advice stands firm to leave GNOME and install XFCE as above. Not as nice, but ... it works. And installs in a minute instead of spending days to find those (no doubt they will exist) few simple commands that will fix the gnome problem.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Trying to answer you question I decided to create HOWTO from the very beginning what I did to get my Drool rules executed on remote server. </p>\n\n<p>My task was to integrate Kie Workbench and Execution Server, so business users be able to create Drools rules and deploy them to the Repo, while developers could use these rules via calling REST services of standalone Drools execution server. </p>\n\n<p>You should follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Before using Drools Execution Server let me use such terminology:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kie Drools Workbench - is UI for creating and deploying Model and\nRules file(s) to Maven Repository</li>\n<li>Kie Execution Server - is standalone Drools execution server. It consumes REST calls of commands and returns execution results</li>\n<li>Assumed you have Tomcat 7.0/8.0 and Maven installed</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Deployment of Drools Workbench</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most stable version of  Kie Drools Workbench to deploy at the moment is  6.1.0.Final. Use this one for deploying on Tomcat 7.0 only!</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You can download file called kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars from <a href=\"https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav~~kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars~~~\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jboss sonar repo</a>, use version 6.1.0.Final and <strong>tomcat7.war</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure you added following jars to Tomcat's lib directory: <strong>javax.security.jacc-api-1.4.jar, kie-tomcat-integration.jar, slf4j-api-1.7.2.jar</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure you have or added following roles/users to tomcat-users.xml of your Tomcat:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p></p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code><role rolename=\"admin\"/> <!-- Tomcat Admin role -->\n<role rolename=\"analyst\"/> <!-- Kie Workbench Analyst role. -->\n<role rolename=\"kie-server\"/> <!-- Kie Drools Execution Server role.

Use admin credentials configured in previous step to enter Workbench. In our case <strong>user1/user1</strong></li>\n<li><p>In Kie Workbench create a Model, Rules file. Validate them and click Deploy. Make sure you have jar file with your project being put to Maven repo!</p>\n\n<p>As an example you can use rule and model I created for testing purposes:\nDrool rule file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import com.arty.drlwb.MyExampleType;\n\nrule \"one\"\nwhen \nMyExampleType(message == \"Hello Worlddddd\")\nthen\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello World:)\");\nend\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Deployment of Kie Drools Execution Server</strong> </p>\n\n<p>For the moment of this To-Do writing the most stable version of Kie Drools Execution Server is <strong>kie-server-services-6.2.0.Beta3.war</strong>.

I have strung together two images as an animation in Photoshop, both high quality off the bat (2000 x 3000 px), I know when I compress into a moving GIF it's going to be slightly lower quality, which is fine as the intended output is 300 x 500 px. My issue is with the blockiness of the background. The images are shot on a grey studio backdrop, and whilst the subject is not blocky in any way, the background becomes heavily pixelated and colour is distorted. I know what I'm doing with settings, dithers and colours etc, so my question is:</p>\n\n<p>Is there are better methodology to creating a high quality GIF without the above issue?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>If you transmit a sequence of bits over some line, errors may creep in. For instance, if the Bit Error Rate of this line is 1%, on average, every 1 out of 100 bits will flip to the opposite value.</p>\n\n<p>For a single transmitted bit, this relates to a Bernoulli trial with $p=0.99$ for being a 'success' and $q=1-p=0.01$ for a failure.</p>\n\n<p>If this same bit is transmitted over two identical lines, there are two pathways of getting a correct result: two correct transmissions or two wrong transmissions (flipping the bit twice). The probability, therefore, is $p*p+q*q$.</p>\n\n<p>Following this sequence for multiple transmissions, we get:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{r\u00A6c\u00A6c}\n\\textbf{ }&\\textbf{correct}&\\textbf{wrong}\\\\\n\\textbf{1}&p&q\\\\\n\\textbf{2}&p^{2}+q^{2}&2pq\\\\\n\\textbf{3}&p^{3}+3pq^{2}&3p^{2}q+3pq^{2}\\\\\n\\textbf{4}&p^{4}+6p^{2}q^{2}+q^{4}&4p^{3}q+4pq^{3}\n\\end{array}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>The parameters in front of each term seem to relate to Pascal's triangle. Furthemore, the 'correct' descriptions seem to be 'symmetric', while the 'wrong' ones are 'anti-symmetric'. Can somebody explain the connection, and is there perhaps a general function which describes this series?</p>\n\n<p>My real question is the following: what if the bits are transmitted across different lines $i$ each with a different BER $p_i$. The table then becomes:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\begin{array}{r\u00A6c\u00A6c}\n\\textbf{ }&\\textbf{correct}&\\textbf{wrong}\\\\\n\\textbf{1}&p_{1}&1-p_{1}\\\\\n\\textbf{2}&2p_{1}p_{2}-p_{1}-p_{2}+1&p_{1}-2p_{1}p_{2}+p_{2}\\\\\n\\textbf{3}&4p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}-2p_{1}p_{2}-2p_{2}p_{3}-2p_{3}p_{1}+p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}&etc.\n\\end{array}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>Is there a general function which describes this behaviour? Can someone explain anything more about this series? Does this have a name?</p>",

(PS. I realise that Amazon is the one not charging this fee.)</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that the usual cost to transfer a .rentals domain would be about $30. Can the registrar just charge arbitrary amounts on each domain?</p>\n\n<p>I'm keeping ownership of the domain. It's not a sale.. I just want to move it to another registrar.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone ever experienced something like this before? Do I have any options available to me? (ICANN complain etc?) When it was registered I wasn't told it was PREMIUM? </p>",

I noticed that when i tried to re-sync the songs to check they weren't corrupt an error came up on the windows phone app thing saying 'something happened we didn't expect error 80004005'.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anyway to fix this? (its a micro sd)</p>\n\n<p>Also when i tried to delete the working artist from my phone it asked if i wanted to delete but then 'copying' came up at the top, what is the phone trying to do?</p>",

		"Title" : "The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something enti...",
		"Body" : "<p>The DMG has a great example of how to change classes into something entirely new without actually destroying the game balance. It says one of the easier ways of \"making a new class\" is to change the spell list. In that way, the power level of the class isn't altered but it does feel different (it exemplifies the use of a Paladin to make a guardian, using arcane magic to protect a powerful sorcerer instead of divine magic to keep his Oath).</p>\n\n<p>So, here is my suggestion of how you're supposed to do it:</p>\n\n<h2>First Suggestion: Changing the traits of a Wizard and turning it into a Invoker:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use the wizard as baseline.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your DM finds it's necessary, change the spellcasting ability to WIS as it was in D&D4e. What you will need to do is to take the Wizard Spell List and change it to make it feel the closest you can get to your old Invoker. Get every destructive spell that reminds you of your encounter and daily powers and eliminate things your invoker certainly wouldn't do (as raising undead).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Intuitive Magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>Change the trait of spells know. The Invoker is sort of a divine sorcerer. Therefore, it should feel that much as a wizard. I believe this class shouldn't be able to prepare spells and have potentially ilimited number of spells known, but it should work just like the sorcerer, having a number of spells to use according to the sorcerer's spell-list. You'll be sacrificing all the wizard's malleability for one extra cantrip and certainty that you'll always get new spells when you level up.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Change the spell foci</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just do it the same way it was with your Invoker Implements. Wizards use wands and crystal balls (I believe), you invoker though, will go for Rods and Staffs only, just like in 4e.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Choose the school of magic</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a DM, I'd limit it into something that would make it feel like you're using divine intuitive magic. Abjuration, evocation and divination are the ones I'd recommend for that matter.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Ritual caster feature</strong></p>\n\n<p>Invokers are supposed to be ritual casters. You already lost you ability to prepare magic. I'd rule that you'd start with one ritual known and everytime you learn new spells, you get to choose a new ritual. You still know less spells than the wizard that way and you get to keep a cool feature.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'm pretty sure those changes won't affect the power of your class and it's all made according to the DMG suggestions of how to change a class. If you change a few features and keep all the rest as suggested, it won't feel as a wizard nor as a sorcerer. Specially with your unique spell list.</p>\n\n<p>If you dislike it, there's a second simpler option that I dislike but it can work for you. </p>\n\n<h2>Reskin the sorcerer.</h2>\n\n<p>This is quite simple. Just change the description of your character. Sorcerers have great mechanics now that makes them feel like intuitive spell casters (sorcery points).</p>\n\n<p>And if you choose draconic magic, you can always say it's not draconic at all. If you get your dragon wings, you can describe it as angelical wings or wings of light. In the end it's a game about imagining it all anyways.</p>\n\n<p>I hope it was helpful.</p>",

Having heard nothing of the rest of the song yet, I initally took it musically. It is a common thing for people to say they are \"all about that bass\", to where the phrase is almost like a sample, except there's no actual recording where someone said it that everybody knows and uses. So, I thought nothing much more about it than just the appreciation of a familiar sample used well. Until she's like \"no treble\". People dont really say they're not about treble,  just that they're all about bass. I initally took it as her just saying that in an extension of being all about bass, while attempting to be witty/cute. To myself, I thought,  \"no treble? That's stupid and makes no sense if you think bout it, since there's not much bass in the song really anyways\"\nOnce I heard the rest of the song, I realized that she probably meant her butt, but then \"no treble\" made absolutely no sense. I never even thought about breasts or the upper body, I was just like, \"what the heck is she talking about; treble?\"\nI started to feel like she was just simply guilty of just saying \"no treble\" because of how shes all about bass and treble is erroneously thought of as being the counter or opposite to bass,( like how capitalism is errobeously considered the opposite, or counter, of socialism),  and that pissed me off a bit to where I'm thinking \"whats wrong with treble? Im all about bass, but treble has its place.\" Hahaha.\nUpon deeper and more thourough analysis, I have come to the conclusion that she perhaps thought of it originally as a knee-jerk response to saying she's \"all about that bass\" (while writing the song i mean. FYI, her and some other guy wrote this song together somewhat quickly, starting from something she had previously wrote or some idea she had had. Yes, i actually spent time researching this...) She might have been thinking of bass in terms of meaning booty at first, but once she said \"no treble\" and liked it, bass as booty leaves the meaning of treble somewhat unclear. So, whether that is how it happened or not, I believe she has decided that bass and treble refer to large and skinny body sizes, respectively. When she says she is \"all about that bass; no treble\" she is referring to herself and speaking as if to a potential \"love interest\" and saying something like, \"I'm a big girl; you ain't gonna find no skinny bitches here.\"</p>\n\n<p>The song plays around with \"hating\" on skinny chicks, calling them bitches then saying she was just kidding, then starting to talk \"shit\" by starting with \"I know you think you're fat\" and even though she just did it,  you don't think she's joking again and dont expect her reassurances of how it is a given that \"every inch of u is perfect\"</p>\n\n<p>But yeah. She means bass to mean big, large, etc and treble to mean thin, skinny, etc. But she also thinks of it as referring to booty, specifically a substantial booty. In this regard, she is not thinking of a treblethat  refers to the body part which is the counter or opposite of a butt, whatever that would be. </p>",

The phone streams music in Win7 with a different system.\nI have tried some suggestions from old threads in this community and other pages but they have slightly different approaches and I always reach a dead end, probably because of n00bness...\nPhone pairs right off a clean Ubuntu 14.04 installation but just for file transfer and Blueman cannot configure it as Audio Source, it says \"connection failed: Stream setup failed\" ???  I have also installed Bluez and PulseAudio.\n\"Enable=Source\" was added at the end of /etc/bluetooth/audio.conf but still PulseAudio does not recognize phone as audio source.\nThis is all mixed up for me because of the different programs and I still do not have a clear picture of which does what. I hope any one here helps me with step by step instructions.\nThanks!!!</p>",

I don't have enough reputation points to add a comment to your answer, so I'll just edit my entry.</p>\n\n<p>The hack was required in addition to the function change suggested by the developer log to make the add-on fully functional.</p>\n\n<p>Updating the function name as you suggested does allow the fieldtype to install successfully, but it still doesn't work right. The fieldtype loads in the entry, but when you put in any address information and hit \"Geocode Entry\" it yields no results. That's why it was suggested to hack the fieldtype code. Like you, I do not recommend a system hack ever, so I am trying to find the portion of the add-on that EE 2.7+ does not like.</p>\n\n<p>I've never built an add-on, so I am at a loss for where to go from here.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>There are <strong>TWO Settings</strong> that are independent of each other: <strong>Auto-Correct</strong> and <strong>Spell-Check</strong>.  \"Auto-Correct\" can inadvertently change what you intended to write, while \"Spell-Check\" just independently and automatically marks misspellings.</p>\n\n<p>To change <strong>AUTO-CORRECT:</strong><br>\n-- Go to <strong>Settings...  Preferences...</strong><br>\n-- Then, on the left pane, under the \"Backup\" section, go to \n<strong>\"AUTO-COMPLETION\" section:</strong><br>\n-- Simply <strong>UN-check</strong> this choice.  (No NPP++ restart required)<br>\nThis does not turn off spell checking, so you will still see misspelled words marked with a red underline.  </p>\n\n<p>To change <strong>SPELL-CHECK:</strong><br>\nSimply toggle the <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Eke1H.jpg\" alt=\"Button with ABC and a ~~~ as an underline, on the toolbar\">, (or the DS button in older versions.) <strong>NOTE: This will NOT change the \"Auto-Completion\" setting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, you are not alone.... This \"Auto-Correct\" problem really \"bugged\" me until today.</p>\n\n<p>In the January 2015 version 6.7.4, by default, \"Spell-Checking\" now does a lot more than just \"check\" spelling.   Auto-Correct has been driving me mad, occasionally fixing my \"spelling\" for things like precise links that now no longer work, which I didn't notice were changed, until they failed.  </p>\n\n<p>NP++ Devs:  Thanks for all your work, but I'd suggest putting an on/off on the toolbar for both Auto-Correct and Spell-Check, and I'd suggest that you turn Auto-Check off by default.  Also, in preferences, call it \"spell-checking\" so we can find it, and allow me to change both settings under one place.  If that means that there are two places in the UI or prefs, then allow me to change both settings, both places, where it is obvious there are two separate settings.  </p>",

He is opening a bicycle store in New York and plans to name it Cycle Fitness. Your firm is to design a new logo for this new shop and as well as for future locations he plans to open. Cycle Fitness plans to hold free seminars on bike safety, cycling for fitness, what to look for when buying a bicycle, choosing the right bike, choosing a bike for a child, and creating a cycle group that will be doing monthly cycle trips. Your firm must design the new logo, a grand opening postcard for mailing, a business card, a rack card that will sit on the counter in a holder indicating all the seminars offered, and a quarter page advertisement, and a tee shirt. The shop\u2019s address is 123 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 20013. Grand opening is June 1. </p>\n\n<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tp48P.png\" alt=\"Cycle Fitness Logo\"></p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I recently came across the following problem on a set of past examination papers for a university module I'm currently taking:</p>\n\n<p>'A video manufacturer produces 8500 video recorders on a continuous \nproduction line every month. Each video requires a tape head unit and these \nare produced very quickly in batches. It costs \u20AC13,000 to set up the machinery \nto produce a batch and \u20AC0.30 a month to store and insure a tape head once \nmade. How large should the batch size be to minimize total costs and how \noften will they have to set up a production run?'</p>\n\n<p>I arrived at the following values:\n - r = 8500\n - K = 13000\n - h = 0.30</p>\n\n<p>While trying to apply the formula to find the optimal batch size for a continuous EOQ model, that is q* = {2KDr/(h(r-D))}^1/2 , I noticed that only the rate of production per month was given, not the Demand of the product. Is there some way to calculate this problem to get around this roadblock or am I approaching the problem incorrectly?</p>\n\n<p>I've tried applying the regular EOQ formula, that is q* = (2KD/h)^1/2 , where Demand is the 8500 value, but I ended up with a seemingly unusual value (which may be completely correct given my lack of experience in this field) : I received an answer close to 27,142 and using q/D to find the time gap between orders I arrived upon roughly 0.3 orders per month.</p>\n\n<p>I came here to ask two things: Is there a way to solve the former continuous model question? Or is the latter question using the basic EOQ model formula closer to being correct?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you in advance, this has been bothering me for the past two days. </p>",

B&H has been successfully sued several times for discriminating against non-Jewish employees,including for paying them less than Jewish employees, and blocking them from management positions.  In the article, Rabbi Daniel Lapin, who is an Orthodox rabbi and an author of several Jewish business books is quoted in the article as saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Lapin maintains that none of the aforementioned allegations undermine B&H\u2019s integrity. \u201CWhere in the Torah does it say that you have to pay all employees the same rate? Where in the Torah is equality depicted as a virtue? The answer is nowhere at all.\u201D The company\u2019s business model, according to Lapin, adheres to God\u2019s plan insofar as it\u2019s described in, \u201CHis book.\u201D</p>\n  \n  <p>\u201CThe notion that there\u2019s a moral flaw in people who, because they don\u2019t pay all their employees the same \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I see the basis for that in morality. It may not be fair, it may not be legal, those are not my areas. But to say that there is a clash with Jewish values simply would not be true,\u201D said Lapin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is Lapin's view correct? <strong>Excluding dina d'malchuta issues</strong>, is it correct that there is no moral problem in Judaism with discrimination?

		"Title" : "Memory leak problem using Irrlicht engine",
		"Body" : "<p>I am using Irrlicht 1.8.1 as part of my game project. Recently I have been struggling with the fullscreen toggling problem, once Irrlicht does not have a default way to alternate fullscreen/unfullscreen at run-time. You have to set this option at the start. This way I had to rewrote the code to make all the engine restart at F11's pressing, the button to toggle, saving all the previous states to make the transition hidden to the player.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, something went wrong and at some time it was made clear that memory leak appeared somewhere during the reset transition. Every time F11 is pressed you can see on Windows Task Bar that the memory used by the software increases mysteriously. I wrote a loop to continuously fullscreen/unfullscreen and left it for some minutes. The needed memory on Task Bar increased from 20k to 30k in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>I reviewed all my code multiple times trying to find out what might be wrong. The search pointed me up to a specific point in my code, exactly where the Irrlicht device is to be restarted. To test it I made the following:</p>\n\n<p>I removed this code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Finish the old device\ndevice->closeDevice();\ndevice->drop();\n\n// Create new device\ndevice = createDeviceEx( params );\n\n// Return new device\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Return old device without finishing it\nreturn device;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The software simply stopped growing up every time it goes fullscreen or unfullscreen. Obviously the fullscreen/unfullsreen stopped working. I know Windows Task Bar is a very crude way to test memory leaks, but the problem is clear. Anyway, I am still learning. I do not know if I am closing the device and replacing it the right way and that is why I may be still leaving some garbage on memory.</p>\n\n<p>I would like some guide here.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Recently, my BEHA induction oven (Type: C632.745DHSrvW, Model: D 644 KI) stopped working. When I turn the induction panel on, instead of showing 0 on all plates, it is now flashing F-5-F-5 on all plates. Sometimes when I turn it on, it works just fine again, but most of the time it's showing the F-5 error code. </p>\n\n<p>I talked to support, and they told me it was most likely something wrong with one of the two chips inside of the oven, and that I could buy one from them and replace it myself. The chip cost 200 USD...... So I got it, replaced the old one, and still have the same problem. I called them back, and they said they take no returns from private customers, so now I'm out 200 bucks on nothing. They also said that this most likely means there's something wrong with the other chip, which is 400 bucks. Still no guarantee that it's going to work. </p>\n\n<p>Since it's sometimes working and sometimes not, it seems weird to me that it's necessary to replace one of these chips - a bad connection seems more likely. Do any of you know any other solutions i could try? Here is an image of the chip I bought: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/XB7TbU3</a></p>",

But then\nthe sentences 2.a and 2.b should be analyzed in the same way, which\nimplies that 2.a is an ergative use of the verb <em>float</em>. But then,\nsentence 2.c should also be ergative. Is that the case?</p>\n\n<p>And then, in successive variations, what of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The man stood near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The dog walked near his boat</p>\n  \n  <p>The man walked his dog near his boat</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>About question 1</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergative_verb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>'s answer is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In linguistics, an ergative verb is a verb that can be either\n    transitive or intransitive, and whose subject when intransitive\n    corresponds to its direct object when transitive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be illustrated by the question examples. But if you look\nat the second example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He fired a gun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can also say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun fired a bullet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and that is transitive.</p>\n\n<p>But what if the verb <em>shoot</em> is used.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He shot the gun</p>\n  \n  <p>He shot a man</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a bullet</p>\n  \n  <p>The gun shot a man</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though I am not sure one would say intransitively</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gun shot</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it all seems a bit more complicated that the simple rule of\nWikipedia and your first question,</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I often find formulas of minerals where some element symbols are grouped within square brackets and separated by a vertical bar. An example can be brochantite, whose formula I find expressed as Cu$_4$[(OH)$_6$|SO$_4$].</p>\n\n<p>I wonder what does such a notation means, and I have made some conjectures, although I find no reference on line or in books. I suppose that the square brackets are used to enclose the set of the anions present in the compound and the vertical bar is used to separates different anions, while the cations remain outside the square brackets. That is just an intuitive supposition. Is my supposition correct? If it is not, what does the described notation mean? I heartily thank you for any answer!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Say someone calls a web service on a server, the relevant data is being retrieved in batches and the message is being streamed to the client. In the middle of the message some kind of exception is encountered. My current implementation sort of just stops streaming the (in this case soap) message and starts building an error message, but obviously the result won't be a valid message or even valid XML.</p>\n\n<p>I considered a few options, none of them seem to make much sense:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Put all the relevant data in memory and then only stream the message itself.</li>\n<li>Do a double-take, so see if it works out with a fake stream and then do the real stream.</li>\n<li>Stream to a disk first and then use a file input stream to stream to the client</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As you can see all have serious downsides in terms of memory/disk consumption, speed/resource efficiency or even validity of the data. How would I best implement error handling in this situation? Do I just have to pick the least worst of these options? If so I tend to favor to the current situation where the message is just invalid in cases like these, because it at least doesn't affect the base case where everything is fine.</p>",

		"Title" : "Blender Texture Bake Problems",
		"Body" : "<p>Hopefully someone can help. I tried to ask this in the question section, but I am not permitted to start new topics yet. This is partially a Unity question and partially a Blender question. I will be asking in both places. Thank you all in advance for any help.</p>\n\n<p>I'm new to CG and have been self educating for the past few months. I have progressed fairly well, but I can't seem to get exactly what I want with my objects when they are displayed in Unity. I would like them to appear as they do in Blender when they are rendered, but I can't seem to duplicate the effects in Unity.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issue I have seems to somehow relate to scaling the texture prior to baking. Objects that do not require scaling prior to the bake to get the texture to display properly (e.g...Rocks) import to Unity perfectly, but Objects that require scaling (e.g....BlockWalls) to get the texture to display correctly go haywire when they are baked (Rock and Ruins were both baked the same way, only difference was the scaling, which I used a Texture Coordinate [UV] and Mapping Vector in Blender to position and scale). The textures show as a black field interspersed with small images of the textured UV unwrapped faces at various intervals on the surface of the object when applied in unity. I believe this is some type of issue with the interplay of light baking to the surface and scaling. </p>\n\n<p>I am able to get the textures into Unity just fine without baking and just save the image files and the .blend directly into Unity, but that's where the texture quality loss is happening. I have also tried various other modifications within Unity to attempt to restore some of the quality lost (e.g.... Bump/Diffuse. Parallax Diffuse, Self Illuminated Bump Diffuse/Parallax Diffuse etc... I do have proper Normal Maps and Parallax Maps, made via Crazy Bump and Gimp).</p>\n\n<p>Also, when I am baking the texture image in Blender, I am in Cycles Render - Object and Image are selected. </p>\n\n<p>I am including screenshots for examples. Any help would be immensely appreciated. <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/9NsAn.jpg\" alt=\"Unbaked Texture in Blender\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/IVsnA.jpg\" alt=\"Baked Texture in Unity3D\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ykF5j.jpg\" alt=\"Rock Texture Baked in Unity3D, Same method, no scaling\"></p>",
