This is the way I did it in my isometric engine. Every object gets a \"depth\" value describing the distance from the camera and every object is put in a list which is sorted by this depth-value. Then everything is rendered in the order of the list.</p>\n\n<p>You have to take into account that you are using isometric view so that the axis are shortened. Try multiplying or dividing by sqrt(2) (or maybe factor of 2). The exact factor and axis depends on your architecture of your map and the use of the axis, which I did not fully understand by now.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know you can not use min/max values but only one single point for sorting (because otherwise you should have to render a part in front and another part behind)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Also try browsing some related questions. There are some more detailed answers already.</p>",

    "Body": "<p>I was completely surprised once regarding a question from a customer while working in a photographic store. The lady was under the impression that there is a fault with her Canon SX20 bridge camera and said that she had this problem for almost a year and it still does the same thing. She stated that she could not get a decent photo of Table Mountain (a famous landmark in Cape Town, South-Africa) and was very displeased. Now considering all possibilities and asking a few tactical questions to get to the real information, she said that it was around sunset (dark) and when I suggested it was possible that there was very little light at the time, her defense was that she had the flash on....... to light up the mountain....... and expose a perfect near professional photograph. I was in shock, as I needed to find a nice way to explain that best results would be achieved by purchasing a tripod (possibly even a remote) and explore the longer exposures instead of trying to rely on auto function with the built in flash popped up. How would you handle this situation and am I the only one or did you experience this before?</p>",

Correct me if I'm wrong:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>By my assumptions, usually we have a frame rate which graphical API runs by it and a frame rate called fixed frame rate which other parties like physics, network etc. run by it.</p></li>\n<li><p>I know with v-sync on, the frame rate for graphical API would be the display device refresh rate which is usually 60hz in nowadays monitors, and with v-sync off graphical API wouldn't wait for display device to draw previous frame completely and it constantly sends the new frame. So, if I turn v-sync on and change refresh rate to something I like, then frame rate for graphical API would be locked by that rate and if I turn v-sync off, then frame rate for graphical API would be as fast as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>If my previous assumptions are correct, then why have we for example a <code>Time.captureFramerate</code> which locks the render frame rate and a <code>Resolution.refreshRate</code> with the same intention in an engine like Unity3D?</p></li>\n<li><p>And, what does it mean when game developers say we locked the frame rate at 30 or 60 frames per second? Does this mean they leave v-sync on and set refresh rate to 30 or 60 and user is not able to alter v-sync at runtime?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If we are to limit the main loop which render operation runs under it, is this the way?</p>\n\n<pre><code>while (main_loop)\n{\n  while (fixed_loop)\n  {\n    // Stuff\n  }\n\n  // Lock main loop to 30 fps\n  if (render_time >= 1 / 30) \n  { \n    render_time -= delta;\n\n    Sleep(1);\n\n    continue;\n  }\n\n  render();\n}\n</code></pre>",

    "Title": "Help me understand adjusted odds ratio in logistic regression",
    "Body": "<p>I've been having a hard time trying to understand the use of logistic regression in a paper. The paper available <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/eye/journal/v23/n1/full/6703049a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> uses logistic regression to predict probability of complications during cataract surgery. </p>\n\n<p>What is confusing me is that the paper presents a model that assigns odds ratio of 1 to baseline described as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A patient whose risk profile was in the reference group\n  for all risk indicators (ie adjusted OR=1.00 for all in\n  Table 1) may be regarded as having a ‘baseline risk\n  profile’, and the logistic regression model indicates a\n  ‘baseline predicted probability’ for PCR or VL or\n  both=0.736%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the probability of 0.00736 is presented with odds ratio of 1. Based on the transformation from probabilities to odds ratios: $o=\\frac{p}{1-p}$   ,this can't be equal to 1 :  $0.00741=\\frac{0.00736}{1-0.00736}$</p>\n\n<p>It gets even more confusing. The composite odds ratios that represents multiple covariates having values different than the baseline is used to calculate predicted risk. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the composite\n  OR from Table 1 would be 1.28 X 1.58 X 2.99 X 2.46 X\n  1.45 X 1.60 = 34.5, and from the graph in Figure 1, we see\n  that this OR corresponds with a predicted probability of\n  PCR or VL or both of around 20%</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only way to arrive at the values the paper is giving as examples is to multiply the baseline probability with composite odds like this:\n$0.2025=\\frac{(34.50\\times0.00736)}{1 + (34.5\\times0.00736)}$</p>\n\n<p>So what is going on here? What is the logic for assigning odds ratio 1 to a baseline probability that is not 0.5? The update formula I've came up with above comes up with the right probabilities for examples in the paper but this is not the direct multiplication of odds ratio I'd expect. What is it then?</p>",

    "Body": "<p>Alright. I've been doing some reading, and the most popular theory is that Adventure Time is set in a post-apocalyptic Earth, with all humans either being mutated or killed off due to the detonation of the Mushroom Bomb. Well, scratch that. If you haven't seen \"The Vault\" it's the episode where Shoko appears, and we learn about her backstory. So we know that Shoko was around after the Mushroom War. Okay, what does that mean? Well, it actually means a lot. If Shoko was around after the bombing, born as a humanoid, then how can Finn be her incarnation? Humans were extinct, yet Finn was born supposedly as a 100% human. Impossible. How does this fit in with the theory that Adventure Time is post-apocalypse? It doesn't. It fits with the second most popular theory. That Finn is in a coma. All of the things that Pendelton Ward thought we couldn't figure out, we did. And that proves that a pre-teen is dreaming up the Land of Ooo, and that Finn is in a coma. The apocalypse never really happened in Adventure Time, it was simply dreamed up by a boy with a wild imagination, and who went through something awful. Also, some of the \"mutated\" humans cannot possibly ever truly be a mutation. I'm talking about Prismo. You all know him, if you're smart you hate him. Prismo is a being of an undetermined rank and an unknown type of life form. Is he even a life form, or just a spiritual being? Prismo is rarely even in the show, but as with Shoko, the most important characters are often the lamest. Prismo cannot possibly be a mutatation, as he is best classified as a being of pure energy with no weakness. (Yes that was a Gravity Falls reference.) Because of these small, but key pieces of evidence, it leads me to believe that this is the most plausible theory of Adventure Time. That Finn is in a coma. Don't kill me for adding this, but Finn could also be dreaming, and is simply asleep. Both of those theories fit this evidence. Okie-dokie-lokie, thanks for putting up with me for this long, bye!</p>\n\n<p>~Rainbow Dash</p>",

The lead asks me to understand the feature without taking any external help.</p>\n\n<p>The feature is technology-wise pretty new to me and I tried to search for any documents available, but unfortunately none are available. The person who has implemented the feature sits just a couple of cubes away from me but as per my lead's approach, I should refrain from getting into any type of discussion(help) with him.</p>\n\n<p>Having spent a couple of days digging into the code and trying to figure things out by myself, I have a faint feeling that it is not a very practical thing to rely on an approach of absolutely no help from people for certain activities. So my question is, what is the scope of help/knowledge transfer in software type of jobs, and is it really possible to do everything without taking anybody's help?</p>\n\n<p>OR What are the different situation/factors based on which one can decide whether to take help or not?</p>",

    "Body": "<p>What I do to get around this is to create a test case at the beginning of the test suite that sets all my common variables (test users, test company, build number, etc...) using the <code>store</code> command. Then I create a test case to log in that uses the variable from the common variables test case. The subsequent test cases also use the variables from the first test cases to run the tests. In fact, I can then create other test suites and add the common variables test case at the top so that all my test suites can use the same variables. This alone has saved me from a lot of headache.</p>\n\n<p>For example you can have let's say a test case called <code>commonvariables.html</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>store|http://websitetobetested.com/|baseURL\nstore|johndoe@hotmail.com|username\nstore|mypassword|password\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then have another test case called <code>login.html</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>open|${baseURL}|\ntype|id=login_username_field|${username}\ntype|id=login_password_field|${password}\nclick|link=Sign In|\nverifyTextExists|Welcome!|\nclick|link=Sign Out|\nclick|link=OK|\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this is just a simple example of a test suite that logs the user in then logs them off. From here on you can resuse the same test cases or even change the variables but use the same test cases in a different suites.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps.</p>",

I was trying to both remove it from the old account, as well as register it with my main email account. Everything was generally fine and I could load app data and such, but the only thing that was technically wrong was that my device wouldn't show up in the Android Device Manager on the correct account. Here are the steps that I took. I checked after every change, so I think it was the last one (the accepted answer, actually) that worked, but it could be any of them.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I removed all google accounts from my phone</li>\n<li>followed the accepted method. IE I deleted the data of the designated apps.</li>\n<li>Restarted phone</li>\n<li>Opened google play store. The first time I opened it, it said that I had no connection so I closed it, made sure that I had internet, and restarted it (ie. close it in the multitasker and reopen it)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Done! Thanks for the accepted answer, that first part I think did the trick. It both removed it from my old account as well as added it to my new one.</p>",

To do that go to SETTINGS>APP MANAGER. Now choose the apps you want to move and if there is an option for MOVE TO SD CARD click on it. The app had been moved. Now if you want other files also to go to sd card, head over to your FILE MANAGER and simply move the apps. This will make a lot of free space in the internal memory of your device.

    "Body": "<p>rm has <code>-i</code> and <code>-I</code> flags to confirm before every removal.  In the past, some distributions have turned them on by default.  This is a terrible idea.  Give the user too many confirmation dialogs for normal operations and they'll begin to habitually confirm them.  This just shifts the requirement to \"be careful\" (always a red flag) to a new and more annoying dialog.  \"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes! YES! God damnit, stupid computer just delete the files YESYESYESYESYES--CRAP I MEANT NO! NOOOOOOO!\"  This is the \"Yes, but I meant no\" dialog problem.  <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/a/71974/28069\">This answer provides a visual explanation</a> of why confirmation dialogs come at the wrong time.</p>\n\n<p>The sort of mistake you describe is a <a href=\"http://www.efcog.org/wg/ism_pmi_hpi/docs/HPI_Articles_Of_Interest/Norman,%20Donald%20A%20-%20Categorization%20of%20action%20slips%20%281981%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">slip</a>, \"the performance of an action which was not what was intended\".  The user typically immediately recognizes the mistake and knows exactly how to fix it.  Unfortunately, Unix does not give the user the opportunity, rm deletes the file immediately.  Every other operating system solves this problem by allowing deletions to be undone, at least for a little while, by the use of the Trash.</p>\n\n<p>There are various trash systems for Unix, and <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/31171/undo-the-linux-trash-command\">this answer is full of suggestions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The question is to alias rm or not to alias rm.  Pros to aliasing rm...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You can't make the slip of forgetting to use the rm alternative.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons to aliasing rm...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You might come to rely on it on systems which don't have it.</li>\n<li>Might cause problems when the disk is nearly full.</li>\n<li>Need infrastructure to periodically empty the trash.</li>\n<li>Have to be sure not to interfere with the expected behavior of rm in programs.</li>\n<li>Might not fully emulate rm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you follow the first argument too far, you wind up using vi (not vim, vi), csh (not tcsh, csh) and other antiquated utilities because they're universally available. Still, there is a danger of overcustomizing your environment. I prefer to take my utilities with me and to make that as easy as possible. YMMV.</p>\n\n<p>Two and three are technical problems.  They can be solved with a clever reaper job which checks the size of the trash and periodically cleans things up, similar to a <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/tmpreaper.8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tmpreaper</a>.  This can be a cron job, or a more clever version can make use of the various file system event infrastructures available on many desktop Linux distributions.  This is not simple, and even harder to do efficiently. Its better to find an existing system than to try to make your own.</p>\n\n<p>The fourth can be dealt with by making your new rm a shell alias, <code>alias rm='trash'</code>, then it will not affect programs.</p>\n\n<p>The fifth is a problem I leave for the reader to solve. rm doesn't have a lot of switches.</p>",

    "Body": "<p>I'm currently developing a plugin for World of Warcraft in LUA to help optimize a recently introduced part of the game, namely Garrison missions.</p>\n\n<p>A Warcraft Garrison (basically a player fortress) has a place where you can assign your followers to go on an mission for you. If these missions succeed, your followers get some experience and you get a small reward, ranging from a bit of money to powerful equipment for you or your followers. A garrison has 20-25 followers and has about 25-30 missions to choose from per day.</p>\n\n<p>A mission has the following attributes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A level between 90 and 100, inclusive.</li>\n<li>(for level 100 missions) An equipment level between 615 and 645, in steps of 15.</li>\n<li>between 1 and 3 slots to send followers with.</li>\n<li>between 0 and 6 mission threats. There are about 10 categories of threats, the names of which are irrelevant. What is relevant is that a follower can have 1 or 2 abilities that can counter these threats. A mission can have the same threat twice.</li>\n<li>A zone type where this mission occurs.</li>\n<li>an enemy type which this mission is fighting against.</li>\n<li>A duration.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A follower has the following attributes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>the race of the follower.</li>\n<li>A level between 90 and 100, inclusive. followers of equal or higher level contribute more to mission success. A follower that is one level beneath the level of the mission is less effective, but still has an effect. A follower 2 or more levels below the level of the mission does not have an influence on the mission success and cannot counter any threats.</li>\n<li>(Starting at level 100) An equipment level between 600 and 655, inclusive. Like normal level, followers of equal or higher equipment level are more effective.</li>\n<li>1 or 2 abilities that are counters for mission threats. A countered threat increases the chance at success. if all threats are countered with followers of equal of higher level, a mission has a 100% chance of success. A follower can have 2 abilities that counter the same threat.</li>\n<li>1, 2 or 3 traits that can give minor chance of success bonuses in specific mission conditions. These don't give as much bonus chance as a full counter, but are useful to optimize for. A trait can counter a zone, a duration or an enemy type. They can also give a bonus for having a specific type of follower on the same mission, or even give an always-on chance of success bonus.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What I understand from some brief chatting with Gamedev.SE, this is basically the Bin Packing problem, with the missions being the packages and the followers being the bins. However, in this case, the bins can combine and are different sizes.</p>\n\n<p>The algorithm I'm looking for aims to do the following in the least amount of time:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Maximize the amount of missions with 100% chance of success;</li>\n<li>Maximize the individual chance of success of each mission that doesn't have 100% chance;</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I could probably bruteforce it, but I'm hoping for a somewhat more sophisticated solution.</p>\n\n<p>What algorithm should I use for this?</p>",

    "Body": "<p><sup>Note, I am not an expert in this, but I am giving my best guess. If you think that something here is wrong, post a comment.</sup></p>\n\n<p>There are indeed many ways to kill a planet:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Descontruct it</strong> - Just send rockets and robots there to grab it piece by piece until nothing else left. This would not sound very interesting, just the sound of robots and ships working. Nothing special happens to the lava in the interior of the planet, which would probably be cooled down by whoever is descontructing it. How long it would take depend on your workers.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shatter it with a big impact</strong> - If you get a large projectile (large a moon or another planet) and throw it with a large relative velocity to a direct impact against the planet, both will be completely obliterated and the pieces (including the lava) will be thrown out in high velocity escaping trajectories to many directions. The velocity must be sufficiently high, otherwise the two might just merge or the pieces might join together again due to the gravity. Also, the heat might vaporize some of things, converting them into plasma. The sound of that would be a explosion so huge that just the sound waves might be enough to blow up your body. This would take just a few minutes I guess.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Swallow it</strong> - If the planet orbits sufficiently close to a star that enters the Giant Red phase, the star will swallows it. Inside the star, the planet would be teared apart in pieces and mixed with the rest of the star, becoming much hotter. Don't know how this would sound. This would take some years.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Crunch it</strong> - If a planet comes too close of a larger planet or a star, passing its Roche's limit, the tidal forces would destroy it. I guess that this would probably sound like a lot of continuous thunders, but way lounder. The lava will be teared apart and depending of the environment (near a star or not) it might either cool down or get hotter. This might take some days.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Crash and merge it with something bigger</strong> - If a planet crashes into a larger planet, into a star or into a blackhole, it will be destroyed. The effects would be similar to the last two methods above. This would take something like a few days probably, depending on the orbital properties. If the object is a star, a brown dwarf or a gas giant, this is essentially the same as being swallowed. If it is a white dwarf, a neutron star or blackhole, all the matter will be converted to what the merger is.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Crash and merge it with a rocky planet</strong> - If your planet is small and rocky and you crash it in a larger also rocky planet, the planets core will merge, the mantles will also merge, a rock-vapour atmosphere will form. It is something similar to the shatter impact, except by the fact that the planets merge instead of being exploded apart. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Slowly boil it</strong> - If a planet orbits very close to a star and it is made mostly of gas content, the stellar wind will blow out the atmosphere of the planet given enough time, making it progressively lighter with progressively less and less gravity. The process is silent because it is very slow and would take millions or billions of years to finish. Not much to say to the lava here, because this is unlike to be able to boil away the lava, which would just cool down until reaching thermal equilibrium.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Rapidly boil it</strong> - If you put the planet in a star grazing hyperbolic orbit around a blue giant star, when reaching the perihelion or somewhere near, it might be blown away and vaporized just like comet Ison was, including the lava. Don't know how this would sound though. This might take just a few days.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Instantly boil it</strong> - If the star that orbits the planet explodes in a supernova or is gamma-ray-bursted, the planet will probably be vaporized in some seconds. Don't know how this would sound.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Destroy it using particle physics</strong> - You might create or find a large quantity of antimatter or strange matter and drop into the planet to blow it up, which would sound like a big explosion. Or build a mini black hole to swallow it up. Or build huge pressures in the planet core to there to create something like a mini <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair-instability_supernova\" rel=\"nofollow\">pair instability supernova</a> (if you can build a mini black hole, this might be doable also, but don't ask me how). All of those would only take a few seconds. <em>Thanks to @jamesqf for the suggestion.</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now to what I think that you are really interested:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Wait it decay</strong> - If you consider dieing via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay\" rel=\"nofollow\">proton decay</a> (if this in fact is possible) this would take a veeeeery loooong time, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe#All_nucleons_decay\" rel=\"nofollow\">something like $10^{40}$ years</a>, but eventually all the planet would decay into elemental particles wandering around the universe like photons and neutrinos. Even if protons do not decay, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe#Future_without_proton_decay\" rel=\"nofollow\">quantum tunnelling will take care of it in no more that $10^{10^{76}}$ years</a>. In the meantime, the lava would freeze out to near absolute zero temperature and this would be a very silently process.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Destroy the universe</strong> - If you destroy the universe, all the existing planets would be killed as well. So all that you would need to do is to sit and wait until the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Crunch</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Rip</a>, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Freeze or Heath death</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum\" rel=\"nofollow\">quantum tunneling to a true vaccum</a>. Again, in the meantime, the lava would freeze out to near absolute zero temperature and this would be a very silently process.</p></li>\n</ul>",
