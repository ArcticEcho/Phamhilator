To add new definitions for site X (in this example lets say, "math.stackexchange.com"),

 1. Create a new directory named "math.stackexchange.com" under the "Bad Tag Definitions"
    folder (which should be in the same directory as the source code).
    
 2. Create a file called "BadTags.txt" in the newly create folder.
 
 3. Then add the desired tags to the file, seperating each tag with a new line.
 
 * Ideally, keep the tags alphabetically ordered, as with how the page is already laid out.
   If you can't or don't bother, mention @Unihedron in your pull request. I'll clean it up.
 
For example, the file should look like this,

addition
big-numbers
multiple
algebra
division
add
subtract
blah-blah
blah
blah
blah-b-b-blah
