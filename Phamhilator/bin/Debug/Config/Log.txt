		"Body" : "<p>These were taken from Sam Storms - [WHY I AM A CONTINUATIONIST]<br><br>\nNew Testament evidence of miraculous gifts among Christians who are not apostles. In other words, numerous non-apostolic men and women, young and old, across the breadth of the Roman Empire consistently exercised these gifts of the Spirit (and Stephen and Philip ministered in the power of signs and wonders). Others aside from the apostles who exercised miraculous gifts include (1) the 70 who were commissioned in Luke 10:9, 19-20; (2) at least 108 people among the 120 who were gathered in the upper room on the day of Pentecost; (3) Stephen (Acts 6-7); (4) Philip (Acts 8); (5) Ananias (Acts 9); (6) church members in Antioch (Acts 13); (7) anonymous converts in Ephesus (Acts 19:6); (8) women at Caesarea (Acts 21:8-9); (9) the unnamed brethren of Galatians 3:5; (10) believers in Rome (Rom. 12:6-8); (11) believers in Corinth (1 Cor. 12-14); and (12) Christians in Thessalonica (1 Thess. 5:19-20).</p>\n\n<p>We must also take note of 1 Corinthians 13:8-12. Here Paul asserts that spiritual gifts will not \"pass away\" (vv. 8-10) until the coming of the \"perfect.\" If the \"perfect\" is indeed the consummation of God's redemptive purposes as expressed in the new heaven and new earth following Christ's return, we can confidently expect him to continue blessing and empowering his church with the gifts until that time.</p>\n\n<p>A similar point is made in Ephesians 4:11-13. There Paul speaks of spiritual gifts (together with the office of apostle)\u2014and in particular the gifts of prophecy, evangelism, pastor, and teacher\u2014as building up of the church \"until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\" (v. 13; italics mine). Since the latter most assuredly has not yet been attained by the church, we can confidently anticipate the presence and power of such gifts until that day arrives.</p>\n\n<p>I could give my person reasoning here, however this is not the site that prompts person view point hence not going by what I have received and seen.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I want to corroborate what chuqui said above and add a bit more detail. Fog works like adding white to all pixels, and it reduces both your sharpness and contrast. Any algorithm that tackles one of these two can be helpful to you. The classics are overall contrast, unsharp mask (try a large radius then a small one) and smart sharpen. But there are also more sophisticated proprietary methods like lightroom's (or camera raw filter's) clarity, capture one's punch, instagram's lux, and most importantly color efex pro's (nik software) tonal and local contrasts. These methods are all based on combinations of those basic algorithms mentioned above, and in my experience work wonderfully in some cases. The reason is that these tools are optimized for improving contrast either only in adjacent pixels or only within specific tonal ranges, and by doing this they boost edge clarity without really driving the overall contrast and saturation off the chart. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, on a subjective note I think the beauty of the shot above lies partially in the smoothness of the fog in it. You may not want to reduce the fog too much. It will make the picture look fake and decontextualized. Fog is your fried there. Play nicely with it and try to get smoothly fading color gradients out of it, while sharpening a little bit. </p>",

For instance, many Canadian and British speakers pronounce the phrase \"none at all\" in a way that others technically hear as \"none a tall\".</p>\n\n<p>If a similar phenomenon were going on with the examples above, we might have phonetic breaks occurring before the [<em>z</em>] in such a way that the consonantal clusters [<em>zg</em>], [<em>zt\u0283</em>], and [<em>zr</em>] would be formed for <em>he's going, she's changing, he's running.</em> </p>\n\n<p>But those clusters don't occur in English at the start of freestanding words.

		"Body" : "<p>I have a lot of cards (10k+ I'd bet) and I keep it simple.  I keep the rares and mythic rares sorted by colors in a binder (Red, Green, White, Blue, Black, Colorless, Lands, Multicolored - I try to keep the multicolored ones of the same colors together too, like all the RB ones together, etc.) I keep all the rest (commons, uncommons) in boxes divided by color, similar to the binder.  I will make exceptions and pull commonly used cards into the binder that would normally go in a box (like Skullclamp for example).</p>\n\n<p>When I build decks, I usually figure out a theme or mechanic I want to play around and then choose colors that are going to support that.  Recently I've been working on a Golgari themed commander deck.  So I know I need to just worry about cards that are black, green, black and green or colorless.  Therefore I only need to look at those parts of my collection.  Since I can never remember all the cards from all the sets, I will pull those cards out and just look and see what might be viable before I make my final selections.  Keeping the rares separate helps speed this up because they are typically powerful cards that I will want to use in a deck.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately my storage strategy is what makes deck building the easiest for me, since that is what I do most with my collection.  If you trade more and want to be able to find specific cards quickly, my strategy would be horrible.  Best thing I can recommend is to look at what you do with your cards the most and decide how to organize them to make that activity as painless as possible.</p>",

In addition, what you are describing sounds more like custom options for ordered products and not necessarily custom options for the order. </p>\n\n<p>Create your SQL install script:</p>\n\n<pre><code><?php \n/** @var Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup $installer */\n$installer = Mage::getResourceModel('sales/setup','sales_setup'); // Thanks, @benmarks\n$installer->startSetup();\n\n$installer->addAttribute('order', 'size', array('type' => 'text', 'grid' => true, 'input' => 'text'));\n$installer->getConnection()->addColumn($installer->getTable('sales_flat_order'), 'size', 'text');\n\n$installer->endSetup();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is important to note that you need to create both the attribute and the column in the table. If you don't, Magento will not save the values to the table.</p>\n\n<p>When you are ready to set the new value, just load up the model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/** @var Mage_Sales_Model_Order $order **/\n$order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($orderId);\n$order->setSize($value);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will also probably need to display the values on the order page. The simplest is to create a block that inserts JS onto the page. Output your HTML to this block and use JS to insert it wherever you want it on the order page.</p>\n\n<p>I can provide more details should you find that helpful.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>There is one legitimate question that might be interpreted as \"asking about social life\" but is actually on-topic for an IT interview: asking if you code (or play with hardware such as Raspberry Pi) for fun. Interviewers are often strongly attracted to candidates who code for fun, play with hardware, attend user group meetings, and in general do activities related to their work whenever they can, on their own time.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, a question like \"What do you do for fun?\" might not be an invitation to discuss salsa dancing, hot yoga, or 17th century war re-enactments, but a prompt to talk about your personal github repo.</p>\n\n<p>Since the question doesn't include a direct quote I can't know if this was the actual intent of the interviewer. However, it wouldn't hurt to <strong>pretend</strong> it was, whether it was or not. If you are one of those nerdy-geeky-hobby people (like me) then an answer like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I love keeping up with the latest releases even if they're just not ready to use in a work environment. I have a server rack at home running about 25 vms and I'll install those CTPs and other pre-releases the day they come out. I love to see what I'll be working with in a year or two when it's stable enough for real use. I've done some play projects with Arduino too and I'll talk your ear off about those over a coffee any time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>can serve everyone's purposes just fine. Alternatively, if you don't do that kind of stuff after work, try:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I love building software and solving customer's problems and I really throw myself into it at work 100%. I know some people do the same sort of thing evenings and weekends but for me I do better recharging myself with entirely different activities that aren't work-related at all. Monday mornings I'm dying to get back to whatever I was working on when I left Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the quite rare case where an interviewer is nervy enough to push further and ask specifically what those activities are, you need to insert a Real. Long. Pause. into the conversation. Not a \"holy crap I need to think fast and make something up\" pause but an eyes-locked, did-you-really-just-ask-me-that-you-didn't-did-you pause. Then try:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I look forward to joining this team and chitchatting about my weekend just like everybody else. Even though my hobbies are entirely harmless and normal, I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to discuss them in the interview, right?</p>\n</blockquote>",

The car system must request a list of media for it to play (I hope it is clever and doesn't ask for photo's too.) From then on my phone started to heat up and my battery started discharging rapidly. This went on for a few hours, long after I had disconnected the phone from the car. Even turning the phone off and restarting it did not clear it. In the end I just looked for running apps, found two processes being run by media. I closed these and the drain stopped. I reckon what is happening is that media keeps trying to handshake with the USB port (or something like that). Some sort of bug in the program keeps it looping when it should close.</p>",

Because their positions are lower than us. In our religion, the last time in our lives is very important for us because when we feel the evil things we know it that we are going to reach the evil where such as hell, lives of the animals. So that is the important time for us. Moreover we can also reach the zombies lives. When we have any donations, we can't change the other lives. So we can also call these interval lives changing from one to another due to the last time. Therefore I want to tell you the zombies also exit. That is my thought.</p>",

		"Title" : "The case for cessationism is in fact not based on any clear witness from...",
		"Body" : "<p>The case for cessationism is in fact not based on any clear witness from Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>It is deemed a doctrine derived from experience, rather than by Biblical study.</p>\n\n<p>The only verse cited for the postulate would be 1 Corinthians 13:8,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; <strong>where there are tongues, they will be stilled;</strong> where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>\n  \n  <p>1 Corinthians 13:8-12</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with this vwrse is there is no clear consensus that this speaks of today.  Tongues will cease.  When? When the perfect comes.  Typically, this is explained as the canon of Scripture--when the perfect Word of God was given, the miraculous sign gifts ceased, hence toungues, prophecy, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that it applies its own meaning to the text, and reads it 'eisigetically' into the text.  Compare the three parts--prophecy, tongues, and knowledge.  What this is speaking to is shown in v12, we shall know even as we are fully known.  To those holding cessationist views, this knowledge would be some form of imperfect knowledge.  To a nom-cessationist, this refers to the Eternal state.  To say that 'knowledge' has passed away, however, is not found in this text.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while this is the <em>only</em> verse that even is offered to support the theory, to those opposed, it not held by those who hold different views as a valid interpretation.  Further, as every other major doctrine in the church is supported on the basis of two or more witnesses, this doctrine is only held forth by this one Scripture of questioned interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Even less Biblical is the case for so called Partial Cessationism.  This view holds that while God yet performs miracles, they are not normative for the church today. Thus, they attempt to circumvent the problem of a single case of evidence of any of the three items disproving the whole thing by declaring its rarity.  In so doing so, they fully abandon the one and only claimed Scriptural tenet they held to.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkably, although he was a cessationist, Charles Spurgeon is recorded to have received prophetic words of knowledge documented in his sermons.  In the course of his preachinf, he was severally moved to rebuke a man in the audience of hidden sin, verified later, of which he had no natural knowledge of.  These cases of supernatural gifting aside, Mr. Spurgeon was a full cessationist.  Unreckognized for what they were, his own gifting appears to have disproved his own doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of tge outcome, however, current cessationists often revert to quoting such as John Calvin who declared that the gifts have ceased.  Proof is left to him as authority, who himself offered no proof, but his mere statement as so is often cited as fact.</p>\n\n<p>It is noted, however, that cessationism is markedly not held by the Catholic tradition.  Part of the propliferarion of the notion of cessationism, then, is in some part linked with through some reformers, in that with the rejection of all things Catholic, they also left the legacy of saints, miracles, prophecies, and visions.  The Catholic church, long having kts recognized saints and so forth, were rejected, and left those apart from it to apparently go quite far in the other direction.</p>\n\n<p>An excellent schollarly article can be found <a href=\"https://bible.org/article/questions-cessationists-should-ask-biblical-examination-cessationism\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><strong>What is the basis for Cessationism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit were first observed at Pentecost;</p>\n\n<p>Acts 2:16-18  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;   And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:   And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: </p>\n\n<p>When Jesus gives the \"great commission\" to the eleven disciples, he describes the ability of believers to supernaturally heal others and be immune from harm from snakes and poison;</p>\n\n<p>Mark 16:15-18  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.   He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.   And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;   They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. </p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note from the Joel prophecy that it includes more than has actually happened so far;</p>\n\n<p>Joel 2:27-32  And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.   And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:   And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.   And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.   The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call. </p>\n\n<p>Peter had every expectation that everything Joel said was about to be fulfilled. When Jesus began his ministry by quoting Isaiah, he stopped short.</p>\n\n<p>Luke 4:17-20  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.   And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 61:1-6  The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;   To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;   To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.   And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.   And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.   But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>It might seem that the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit are intended for the Kingdom. They were in evidence when the kingdom was immanent. (Paul was bitten by a snake and unharmed, Peter and Paul healed people including raising the dead, tongues were in use, and devils were being cast out)</p>\n\n<p>There are three main views of spiritual gifts today.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Spiritual gifts are fully functional and available to all Christians today.</li>\n<li>Spiritual gifts are only partially available today.</li>\n<li>Spiritual gifts have ceased functioning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The biggest support for the view that spiritual gifts have ceased to function is empirical. The dead are not raised. Those who support full or partial gifts have to either cling to a distant report of some unverified incident or exaggerate the talent of a teacher or administrator as a \"gift\" from the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Prayers are answered. Healing does take place. The Holy Spirit does lead people to have the right words to say at the right time. However, supernatural gifts were not so subtle or transient as to be indiscernible from talents.  </p>\n\n<p>Peter said that the receiving of the Holy Spirit was told by Joel. Joel describes something very much related to Israel and can be considered Kingdom related. If one sees the offer of the Kingdom to Israel as withdrawn at the destruction of the temple or the diaspora, then one might see that the function of supernatural gifts would also be withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>When a faithful remnant is found in Israel (as described in Revelation), I would expect that the Kingdom would once again be immanent and that the gifts of the Holy Spirit would once again be poured out. I would also expect that the portions of Joel and Isaiah that were expected by Peter and truncated by Jesus would also come to pass.</p>",

You cannot do this\nin Mathematica:</p>\n\n<p>q={x=1,y=2,z=3}\ns= Sin[x]+Cos[y]+Tan[z]\nWith[q,s]</p>\n\n<p>because \n1. the list q will evaluate to {1,2,3},\n2. the undesirable side effect will assign global values to x,y,z.</p>\n\n<p>And there appears to be no way of stopping this by Hold etc\nthat is acceptable to With[].</p>\n\n<p>So you do this:</p>\n\n<p>qq={x->1,y->2,z->3}\n  s /. qq</p>\n\n<p>Another way, not available in Mathematica, is to have some sort of \nmacro expansion in which you generate a form, which could be With[], or\nModule[], such that the unevaluated forms of the assignments are assembled and\npassed into Module, and only then the whole thing is evaluated. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a proper macro facility in Mathematica?  It seems to me that it would be rather hard to construct given the evaluation semantics.</p>",

He is the way the truth and the life.  The gates of hell fell when Christ entered it.

		"Body" : "<p>For basic organizational purposes, compressing the folders on a per-client basis\u2014or per-project basis\u2014simply makes it easier to reference the material later on. I generally divide up my client work folders between the generic, sundry stuff like notes and invoices. And then have code and related assets in another folder.</p>\n\n<p>I use Mac OS X and what I like to do is create an encrypted disk image using Apple\u2019s built-in \u201CDisk Utility\u201D for each client so I can safely take those files, archive them somewhere and not have to worry about prying eyes checking out file contents. Just create an image that is big enough to hold your files, choose an encrypting method\u2014I use 256-bit AES\u2014and create the disk. Then I store these images on an external hard drive I toss in a closet that is essentially my \u201Ccold storage\u201D for old client work; out of sight and out of mind. With hard drive prices getting cheaper, I have two of these project/client/work drives that are essentially mirrored backup copies of each other; I might not want to deal with these files but if I have to dust them off years down the line I want to make sure the data is recoverable in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of archiving is you ensure that file metadata such as access and modification dates/times are retained. This might not seem like anything significant to you, but perhaps in the future you want to create a nice portfolio of your work and want to make sure you get the timeline right? Well, by having all of the files archived you are assured that none of the files had access or modification time/date stamps mucked around with either accidentally or intentionally. Also on the legal side of things, let\u2019s say something requires you to prove work you did was done a certain date/time? Having an archive with date/time stamps that are frozen you are in better shape when engaging in the nonsense some clients might engage in to blame you for something you might not have done.</p>\n\n<p>Performance-wise, I basically think that keeping unwanted, unneeded files on your \u201Clive system\u201D taking up space is a bad use of resources. My main system disk is about 50GB to 60GB in size. I only ever keep active client work on that. If I were to keep all client projects on my main hard drive, I would have 200GB to 300GB of dead weight just sitting there. Removing it from them main drive makes it easier for me to perform backups of the main hard drive. And it\u2019s made it easier and quicker to recover a backup if my system drive fails.</p>",

		"Title" : "Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the w...",
		"Body" : "<p>Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the whole thing at face value, then it doesn't start at Romans 6:1, it goes back before that. 6:1 begins with a question based on what he just said, which goes back to chapter 4. Righteousness is imputed by simply believing what God says, not because of what we experience, but in spite of what is experienced (when Abraham was 99 years old and it was impossible to fulfill God's promise, he believed God anyway...in spite of what he saw/experienced, etc.), which takes us back to chapter 3 and imputed righteousness by faith (simply believing God). That then becomes the premise moving forward, faith...not experience, believing God. </p>\n\n<p>You simply believe God and take him at his word. He lists a bunch of good stuff in 5 which we receive by faith, even undoing what Adam brought. So much is this true, so great is our salvation, so sure our justification, that it might be concluded that we can do whatever we want now that we are saved and still be good with God. Hence the beginning of chapter 6...based on everything that has come before it. </p>\n\n<p>The assumption in 6 is that a Christian will not continue in sin because the Christian has been baptized into Christ's body, been put to death with Christ, put in the grave with Christ and has raised again unto new life. He uses the example of two seeds being planted into the ground together. We are challenged to believe this just like Abraham believed God could still produce seed when his body was now dead at 99 years old. He believed God even though it was hard to believe, in fact, it was contrary to his experience. \"He stumbled not at the promises of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.\" So should we be, in chapter 6 and believe that God says our flesh is dead and, as a result, we are free from sin.</p>\n\n<p>He finishes out 6 without a shadow of a doubt that the old man is dead, saying three times that we are free from sin. Then he moves into 7 with a statement followed by an analogy. He says, if you are dead (like we are in Romans 6) then we are free from the law. Just like a woman who is married to a mean old man wanted to be free from him but could not break the law. Her old man had to die for her to be free to marry the new man. Notice the law did not die, the old man did. Hence, the old man is dead and we are free from him completely (as the law ends at the grave).</p>\n\n<p>This continues perfectly in past tense language, bringing in the law as an example, using himself before Christ. This goes down to verse 14. Here he switches language to draw a point. What happens when a person tries to please God by the law? This whole argument is about a religious person under the law trying to live up to it, the harder you try the worse it gets, the more guilt you feel for failing. After verse 14 he uses himself in past tense language as if he were still a religious person trying to live up to it, wanting to be free from the power of the flesh (which was put to death in chapter 6). </p>\n\n<p>Why would he do this? Because he was the poster child of good religious guy. This is not Paul currently, this is Paul using past tense language to describe the futility of trying to please God through good works.</p>\n\n<p>In verse 24 and 25, he asks the question, \"who shall deliver me from the BODY of this death?\" he recognizes the problem is the body...the flesh...that thing which was put to death in chapter 6. He answers it... \"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" He did it, the fight is over. </p>\n\n<p>To confirm this interpretation, he continues into chapter 8 with this statement, which would seem strange if Paul, was still in the condition described in chapter 7. He says:</p>\n\n<p>Romans 8:1-8  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. <strong>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They that are in the flesh cannot please God! That's the problem with the guy in chapter 7, he was still in the flesh..so he could not please God. But 6, most of 7, and 8 all say that the Christian is not in the flesh. </p>\n\n<p>Now, think about this. If Paul existed, as a Christian, in chapter 7, then he said he could not EVER control himself. In fact, every time he tried to, he failed. He just could not do the right thing! He knew what the right thing was, but he just couldn't do it...ALL THE TIME! \"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.\" Really? Are you that way? Can you never do the right thing?</p>\n\n<p>That is not the prison on death row saying that, that is the Apostle to the gentiles. the writer of most of the books of the NT, the great Paul. </p>\n\n<p>All through the book of Romans he uses the same thought continually. It would be very strange to say that he suddenly switches and contradicts himself for about 10 verses and then goes right back to his original argument. A better thought would be that he simply used language to prove his point that a man outside of Christ who is trying to live up to a law to earn his salvation cannot do it. It is only through Christ that he has hope of pleasing God.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Paul is speaking to believers who have been exposed to the teachings of the church, which is that selfishness and greed is sin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Luke 16:13-17 NET</strong> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\u201D\n   The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him. But Jesus said to them, \u201CYou are the ones who justify yourselves in men\u2019s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God\u2019s sight.\n   \u201CThe law and the prophets were in force until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urged to enter it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If believers confess/agree the above is true, they are no longer \u201Dsinners\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>However, we are saints in bodies of death, bodies that crave to satisfy the natural appetites, sometimes excessively or in the wrong situation. You may want to indulge your love of rich food to the point of gluttony which may be lawfully available with money of your own. Lawful but unrighteous. You may lust after your neighbours property or wife, which are unavailable because of unlawfulness. Unlawful AND unrighteous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:21-22 NET</strong> So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>2 Corinthians 7:1 NET</strong> Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1 John 2:1-2, 5-10 NET</strong> Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. (My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous One, and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The gist of Romans 6 is that as Christians, we are dead to sin, and thus free from it. We are no longer slaves to sin, but are slaves to God and righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 6:16-18 (ESV) Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing what sin is and its consequences, you are set free. The Pharisees did not even know that their behaviour was sin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, I don't think many Christians would say that they feel very free from sin. In fact, Paul goes on in the next chapter to say that he is a slave to sin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 7:18-19 (ESV) For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This kind of language doesn't sound very \"free\". If he says that Christians are \"slaves of the one whom you obey\", and yet he finds himself obeying the flesh, doesn't that make him a slave to sin? In what way, then, are Christians \"free\" from sin?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Walking in The Light</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scripture tells us that when we believe God wants us to conquer the giants of sin, even though we feel like ants and grasshoppers with regard to being up to the task, He will give us victory. Belief, leads to God giving us the Holy Spirit. Read Galatians 3 for details of what happens when the Spirit is given.</p>",

Luckily, Dell provides compatibility information with the cards it sells, and the Radeon 7750 is compatible. However, I've done enough research to realize that the charged price (nearly $200 with tax) is more expensive that what that type of card is usually sold for. If I buy this card from somewhere else, like Amazon for example, will it still work, or is there some difference that will interfere?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&cs=04&sku=a6523076\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"The card in question\"></a></p>",

Obviously he can fly anything with a propeller. When I showed him this devise,and being objective and honestly blunt, he encourage me to go further. There is no one, <strong><em>repeat</em></strong>, no who can start an aircraft with this device installed but the owner and or his designee. You can leave the keys in the ignition, the cabin door unlocked, the wheal locks off and eliminate the chains on your props.I need your input! Here's my take. Must it be approved by the FAA before marketing and sales? Where do I go next? I want to test this device with some authenticity.Anybody with some dexterity and can change a light bulb, can install this devise in 30 minutes.Your comments please! </p>\n\n<p>Thank you, davidfaustin@yahoo.com</p>",

		"Title" : "Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...\n...",
		"Body" : "<p>Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. (Luke 19:26, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Luke version appears to add some helpful context, so I suggest reading that chapter.  A few directions that seemed to have some sort of foundation...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Luke version of the verse comes at the end of parable about the stewardship the nobleman's servants choose while he was away.  10 servants are all given the same amount of money.  When the nobleman returns, he asks what has been done with it.\nOne man traded diligently and turned it into 10.\nAnother turned it into 5.\nBut one stashed it away in fear of the nobleman.\nAt the end, the coin he had kept is taken away from him and given to the one who gained up to 10.</p>\n\n<p>So one thought that comes forward to me is that it may relate to courage\\faith\\understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Because the descriptions in Luke emphasize that the servant did nothing because of his fear.  A fear of the nobleman as much as anything.  Because he is \"austere\" and productive.  Those who had faith went out and used it and got more.  Those who didn't lost what they they had.\nUnderstanding is a bigger picture that may fit because understanding is centered upon fear of the Lord (e.g. Prov 1:7)... which would then really put the Matthew 13:12 into more context coming from:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 11He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. (Mat 13:10-11, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A second avenue of consideration comes from the words introducing the whole parable...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. (Luke 19:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The parable in Luke suggests that the nobleman <em>expected</em> gains from trading.  And his criticism was that the servant could have at least gotten some gain just by putting it in the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Because His point here is that the Kingdom isn't immediately coming, it follows that this is a message to them of what they should be doing going forward.  Not keeping their light hidden, but going forth in service and evangelism as He had displayed to them.  That being fully happy to sit on one's faith feeling secure suggests maybe one doesn't have the faith in Jesus\\God, the repentance of putting oneself first, that such faith would be.</p></li>\n<li><p>A third connection may start in the situation just before the parable in Luke 19, and may have motivated it.  Zacchaeus the tax collector was rich.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. (Luke 19:7, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is given just after Luke 18:18-27, where Jesus speaks of how very hard it is for the rich people to enter Heaven, being harder than passing a camel through the eye of a needle.  So could this verse\\parable also serve to remind us not to look on men by what they have, but by who they are?  That we must be careful not to judge men by their appearance, by who they are financially, but by what they do.  If nothing else, a reminder at least that men of any class can be saved, and does deserve real effort from believers as well.  And in Matthew 13:8, it does echo some of the same leadin, saying some brought forth an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p></li>\n<li><p>And one final connection that really catches me perhaps most...the idea that if you fight to hold onto what you cannot keep (your life), you lose even it.  If you give up your life to Him,  then you life a life with purpose now, and life everlasting to come. I believe Paul or Peter says something very similar to this in one of their letters, but I cannot find it unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>The servant thinks he has held onto something. He has, by his reasoning, seemingly made himself safe from failure.  But he held onto what was never his to begin with (the coin that the nobleman had given him, in the Luke verse).  Echoed in the verse</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. (Mat 16:25, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of the four, the riches connection perhaps makes me the most unsettled.  The support noted in Matthew doesn't seem solid, and nothing else in the surrounding context there seems to supports it.  But maybe the failing is on me to be secured in the message of not judging by appearance that is certainly given other places in the Bible (James 2, John 7, Luke 15, etc).\nBut, all four messages seem to have some support to them.  And perhaps tie together in the end.  But, regardless, I hope I didn't detour your question too much, haven't ENTIRELY talked your ears off, and have added some helpful thoughts.  Thanks for your time :-)</p>",

We've grown quite a bit lately, and this is in fact down from 11% a few weeks ago.</p>\n\n<h1>Data Scrutiny</h1>\n\n<p>Now, admittedly, I don't know how good that data is. They infer it based on cookies and such, as far as I understand it, so it's definitely possible that it's not that bad, or that it's worse. It's also worth noting that Quantcast looks at unique visitors to make these estimates, and not, of course, unique <em>posters</em>. One can infer the problem, but realistically I'm looking for more gender-balance in posters, and visitors is simply a side-effect.</p>\n\n<p>I say this all not because I doubt the data, and it is in fact more than lined up with what I've experienced on the site, but I want to make it clear what my evidence is actually supporting.</p>\n\n<h1>Question</h1>\n\n<p>How can I attract more female contributors to the site?</p>\n\n<h1>Hindrances</h1>\n\n<p>As most of us know, women don't currently hold a nearly-fair (not to make this political or anything) power in most businesses, and startups are pretty similar. That said, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steve-blank/its-about-women-running-s_b_6517516.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">there does seem to be</a> a \"revolution\" of sorts going on, and <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-20/women-who-run-tech-startups-are-catching-up\" rel=\"nofollow\">we're seeing a lot more</a> women in lead positions in startups.</p>\n\n<h1>Brainstorming</h1>\n\n<p>The best idea I've thought of so far is to reach out to some local predominantly female networking groups and ask them to post a link to us on their website. I can do that, but I don't know whether that will really raise the percentages or not. I'll probably do it anyway, since marketing is important to us now regardless, but I'd appreciate some way that was a bit less granular than that.</p>",

The db design gives good flexibility, but one trade off is the ability to draw lots of related information in just one or two queries.</p>\n\n<p>A better way might be to kill those extra queries by stripping out the term columns displayed in the post list (but you would lose the various sorting, limiting, etc. tools that the wordpress list gives, though you could build your own filters, sorting, etc. in as wanted) using the <code>manage_*_posts_columns</code> filter.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I'm facing a new Enterprise Project in Java about data migration. \nI have did one of them in the past, now I want to do a better work and I think I need your considerations.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's me explain the problem:\nI have a lot of DB tables without any logical wire. So in the most of the cases i need to perform a huge logic in the java application for build the correct results.\nIn past I have tested some advices, but in the end i used a lot of HashMap for store in memory the entries retrieved from db and perform the logic I wanted. I was really lucky because the entries were not much for the memory machine.</p>\n\n<p>The question you maybe you think now is: why you need to store all the entries into hashMap?</p>\n\n<p>Example: I have TABLE1 and i need to perform a logic to all the entries. So i have an HashMap with original data taken from db (key: the id of the table, value: the entry POJO) and they can be retrieved by a sequence of queries without load all on memory.\nThe second HashMap contains the modified data sets of the TABLE 1.\nThen I have TABLE 2 to perform another logic but I need the first modified data sets to perform other task. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end I must necessarily have in memory all the HashMap that contains the modified data sets for do all the logic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I searched a lot on the internet to see if you can put a caching mechanism, but I am very confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I would need is an intelligent algorithm that saves me the entries of HashMap on disk in case of need, but it should be fast enough to recover data when I need</strong>. Another alternative would be to save the changed data on db and use a massive amount of queries, \nbut I would avoid it because the results that interest me will not be saved to the database</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be appreciated, Thank you all!</p>",

A crack in between an oil gallery and a coolant passage either in the engine block or the cylinder head(s). There could be some other reasons but it has been my experience that if you have oil in the water you have a serious problem because oil pressure is higher than coolant pressure except with a hot engine that is turned off and in that case you'll have some water in the oil as well but if you have a crack in one or both of the heads above the coolant level (with the engine off) then only a trace amount of moisture will cross over and will usually be evaporated by engine temps. Take my advice, drive em like you stole em and when they won't take anymore scrap em</p>",

Suppose that I have a density function $m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, that describes the abundance of some quantity in a vector space $\\Omega = [a,b]^{n}$. Now suppose that the density at each point in vector space changes over time, with a rate that may be dependent on the presence/absence of density at every other point in space</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\partial_{t}m(\\boldsymbol{x},t) = m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)F(\\boldsymbol{x},?),\n$$</p>\n\n<p>where $F$ might be something like</p>\n\n<p>$$\nF(\\boldsymbol{x},?) = \\int_{\\Omega} m(\\boldsymbol{y},t) k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}) \\; d\\boldsymbol{y}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>i.e. a function of the focal point of interest $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and all other different points $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in vector space, where $k$ is some kind of kernal(?). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: \nWhat notation should I use to refer to the state of the system over the whole space? What should replace my question mark in $F(\\boldsymbol{x},?)$, should it be $F(\\boldsymbol{x},m)$, or maybe $F(\\boldsymbol{x},\\Omega)$, or something else? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: \nI have an extended part to this question that I'm not even really sure how to explain. Suppose I now have multiple dynamical systems like the one just described, and a second 'higher order' density function $M(?,t)$, that describes the abundance of each dynamical system in some other kind of space. What would the notation for that look like? How would I refer to a particular dynamical system (i.e. the question mark again), what would the space be, etc.? Essentially, I'm interested in whether I could formulate a dynamical equation that is analogous to a hyperbolic PDE, but one in which the flux of the density $M$ is no longer defined by a finite system of ODEs, but by an infinite number of PDEs. </p>\n\n<p>PS I apologise if the first question is stupid, and the second question doesn't make any sense. I don't really have any formal mathematical training, but I'm desperate to get to grips with this kind maths for possible use in my PhD. Any advice or links would be much appreciated. </p>",

		"Title" : "\n  When a program starts it has fixed data structures with fixed data\n\n\n...",
		"Body" : "<blockquote>\n  <p>When a program starts it has fixed data structures with fixed data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a bit of a misconception. It has a fixed form and a fixed set of rewrite rules but these rewrite rules can explode into something much larger. For instance the expression [1..100000000] in Haskell is represented by a very small amount of code but its normal form is massive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can't add new data to these structures</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes and no. The purely functional subset of a language like Haskell or ML can't get data from the outside world but any language for practical programming has a mechanism for inserting data from the outside world into the purely functional subset. In Haskell this is done very carefully but in ML you can do this when ever you want.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are no variables in the code</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is pretty much true but don't confuse this with the idea that nothing can be named. You name useful expressions all the time and constantly reuse them. Also both ML and Haskell, every lisp I have tried, and hybrids like scala, all have a means of creating variables. They just are not commonly used. And again the purely functional subsets of such languages don't have them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can merely \"copy\" from the already data or currently calculated\n  data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can preform calcultion by reduction to normal form. The best thing to do is probably to go write programs in a functional language to see how they do in fact preform calculations.</p>\n\n<p>For instance \"sum [1..1000]\" is not a calculation I want to preform but it is quite handily done by Haskell. We gave it a small expression that had meaning to us and haskell gave us out the corresponding number. So it defiantly preforms calculation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If data structures are supposed to remain as they are (immutable), how the hell does someone add a new item in a list?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don't add a new item to a list, you create a new list out of the old one. Because the old one can't be mutated it is perfectly safe to use it in the new list, or where ever else you want. Much more data can be safely shared in this schema.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the point in having a program that can't get new data? Say you\n  have a sensor attached to your computer that wants to feed data to the\n  program. Would that mean that we can't store the incoming data\n  anywhere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as user input goes, any practical programming language has a way of getting user input. This happens. However there is a fully functional subset of these languages that you write most of your code in and you reap the advantages in this way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is functional programming good for machine learning in that case?\n  Since machine learning builds from the assumption of updating the\n  program's \"perception\" of things - thus storing new data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would be the case for active learning but most machine learning I have worked with (I work as a code monkey in a machine learning group and have done so for a few years) has a one time learning process where all the training data is loaded in at once. But for active learning you can't do things 100% purely functionally. You are going to have to read in some data from the outside world.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At first, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription: In Feynman diagrams we have a lot of Green's functions connected by some rules, the Feynman rules. Actually, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription is more related to the Green's function. The prescription is responsible for a choice in the boundary conditions (asymptotic behaviour). We may put this $i \\epsilon$ inside the expression $(\\omega + i \\epsilon)^2$ or $(\\omega - i \\epsilon)^2$. The first is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Retarded_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">retarded Green's function</a>, the second is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Advanced_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">advanced Green's function</a>.  This choices of boundary condition are related to some adapted Feynman's rules. Calculating things in this prescriptions is not manifest relativistically and not so compact. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Feynman_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Feynman Green's function</a> is the best for doing calculations and very natural.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's be more general. This prescriptions are aroused when we have operators like this:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n(H-E)G(t)=\\delta(t)\n$$</p>\n\n<p>We want to find an expression for $G(t)$. Applying Fourier transform, we can find that</p>\n\n<p>$$\nG(x) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)} \\int d\\omega \\, \\frac{e^{-ip(t)}}{\\omega - E\\pm i\\varepsilon}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>If you see this function in complex plane, we can se that we have a cut in real axis made by eigenvalues of $H$. The prescription $\\epsilon$ determine how far we pass about the singularity $\\omega=E$. The choice of signal tell in what side.</p>\n\n<p>This precription is simply procedure to getting inverse of operators with real eigenvalues, satisfying some asymptotic behavior. </p>\n\n<p>We can interpret this $\\epsilon$ as a inverse of timelife of the signal describe by the repective Green's funciton. This is because we can identify a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Breit%E2%80%93Wigner_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">relativistic Breit\u2013Wigner distribution</a></p>\n\n<p>The untary is hold because we get $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, so the signal persist at infinite time.</p>\n\n<p>The adiabatic turn on and turn off interaction is another mathematical departure: adiabatic theorem and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_and_Low_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gell-mann and Low theorem</a>, but physically is very close to the $i\\epsilon$. Is a inverse of a caracteristic time that is send to infinity. </p>",

		"Title" : "A redox reaction is any reaction in which oxidation and reduction are oc...",
		"Body" : "<p>A redox reaction is any reaction in which oxidation and reduction are occurring. The word redox is a portmanteau of REDuction-OXidation. So, if we can correctly identify reduction and oxidation, we can identify redox reactants. In practice, this can be a little challenging, so I will focus first on the second part of your questions (definitions) and then go back to the reaction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ionization is any process that produces ions. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conversion of a hydrogen atom to a hydrogen ion by loss of an electron is an ionization. \n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\nSo to is the reaction of hydrochloric acid and water, which produces hydronium ions and chloride ions.\n$$\\ce{HCl + H2O -> Cl- + H3O+}$$</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation is a loss of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of hydrogen atoms to hydrogen ions is an oxidation.\n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So to is the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{2CO + O2 -> 2CO2}$$</p>\n\n<p>Note that this type of reaction is what gave us the word oxidation - compounds are reacting with oxygen and atoms end up with more oxygen atoms bound to them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reduction is a gain of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of chlorine atoms to chloride ions is a reduction.</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So too is the conversions of acetylene to ethane:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{C2H2 + 2H2 -> C2H6}$$</p>\n\n<p>Not all oxidations and reductions are ionizations. There is a simple mnemonic in English for remembering oxidation and reduction: OIL RIG (Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation and reduction happen together. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In principle we can write an equation that shows only oxidation:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>but oxidation cannot happen on its own. That electron that was lost needs to be picked up by something else. This reaction that shows only oxidation is called a \"half-reaction\" and needs to be coupled with a reduction half-reaction to show a valid chemical reaction:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\n$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$\n$$\\ce{H + Cl ->HCl}$$</p>\n\n<p>In the other examples I gave, both processes are occurring. In the oxidation of carbon monoxide, the oxygen molecules are being reduced.</p>\n\n<p>The surest way to identify oxidation and reduction (and thus redox) is to compare the oxidation states of the reactants and the products. Determining oxidation states/numbers is more complex that I want to put here, so start with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state#Determining_the_oxidation_state_or_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For the carbon monoxide example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                  reactants    products\nC                 +2           +4\nO (bonded to C)   -2           -2\nO2                0            -2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The carbon atoms are being oxidized (oxidation number increased) and the oxygen atoms in $\\ce{O2}$ are being reduced (oxidation number decreases). The oxygen atom already attached to carbon did not change its oxidation number.</p>",

		"Title" : "I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe ...",
		"Body" : "<p>I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe your confusion has confused me, too. That's great, because it made me look for the answers myself. This is just my personal guess (though grounded in some fact), but it makes a lot of sense to me, and I hope it makes sense to you, too.</p>\n\n<p>Bear with me if this is a long answer.</p>\n\n<p>First off, when we speak of the difference in the amount of electrons just before and just after a resistor, you're right: there is fundamentally no difference in the number of electrons. We know this because all the electrons (current) that comes in must be equal to the number of electrons (current) that comes out. This is one of Kirchoff's laws. Moreover, we know that matter doesn't just disappear and it isn't being converted into energy, either.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the second of Kirchoff's laws tell us that the sum of all the voltages in a circuit must be zero (so, in a simple circuit, the initial voltage from the battery minus all the voltage drops from all the resistors is zero). That tells us that something must already be happening within those resistors that has nothing to do with the battery. So that's a good start.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we should also understand that current and voltage are not the same thing. That is, if you <em>already</em> have a flowing current, that current does not have its own voltage. You might need voltage to jumpstart the flow of current, but once it's already flowing, the current exists as the jumping of one electron across ions, and each electron is only a single point -- it doesn't have voltage because it's only one point. More importantly, current flows uniformly, so there is no voltage that is being generated as it does flow. Whether it is just before or just after the resistor, the current is the same there, and it produces no voltage.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a drawing I made for you:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3hH3.png\" alt=\"Drawing of current\"></p>\n\n<p>I drew it as it really is, against the convention. Notice that, despite there being a pre-existing voltage difference between the two batteries, the distribution of electrons is uniform. So, if you tried to take a voltage difference between the first electron and the fourth electron, you get a voltage difference of zero, <em>even if they are flowing</em>, because their distribution will continue being uniform. This, I think, is the equivalent of measuring the voltage across a wire with no resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Because I think it will be useful in analyzing what happens across the resistor, I'd like to point out that the battery is the initial source of voltage. It's made so that one end is much more electronegative than the other, and that one pole has a large supply of electrons whereas the other has a large deficit. So, if you link the two ends together, the electrons flow from the less electronegative end (with more electrons) to the more electronegative end (with less electrons). In the process, the difference in electrons from pole to pole equalizes. Moreover, the chemical reactions happening inside the battery make it so that the poles (anode for negative, cathode for positive) degrade both cathode and anode -- unless it's a rechargeable battery, in which case this reaction is reversible.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn't quite spell out why there is a voltage drop across the load. If the voltage difference exists between the poles, then shouldn't the same voltage difference exist all throughout the circuit? The answer seems to be yes... but only if there is no load.</p>\n\n<p>So, we have to go back and ask, what is a voltage drop, and where does it come from?</p>\n\n<p>I think your question really is, what happens to the energy at a molecular level? It doesn't just disappear. When the voltage drops, what does it mean? If the same amount of electrons enter the resistor and then leave it, doesn't their energy stay the same?</p>\n\n<p>First, we know that if their energies are the same, then the voltmeter will tell us there is no voltage. We also know that, if their energies are the same, there is no difference between the two points. And finally, if their energies are the same, we know that no energy was lost, and therefore, no work was taken out of the system.</p>\n\n<p>But we <em>do</em> know that work was taken out of the system, and we can see the voltmeter giving us a reading. But if the number of electrons is the same across the resistor, then there <strong>must</strong> be energy being lost. But, where did that energy come from?</p>\n\n<p>We go back to what voltage is -- it is the amount of energy per unit charge. One unit of charge is the electron. So voltage is just the measure of how much energy each electron carries. There are two separate energies in the electron -- its rest energy and its momentum energy. Its rest energy is constant, but its momentum energy is definitely not.</p>\n\n<p>An electron carries energy by its orbital and shell. That is, the more energy an electron has, the higher up it goes into its shell. I think this is because it has more kinetic energy, so it tends to move faster. Moving faster causes it to occupy a larger volume, and so for the nucleus to keep the electron, there must be more pull to keep it in place. I'm imagining it's like the orbit of a planet around the sun, where wider orbits signify more total energy in the system. The orbitals are (I'm guessing, but fairly certain) caused by the discrete nature of energy -- photons are the most irreducible form of energy, so an electron can only jump between orbitals by discrete amounts.</p>\n\n<p>So, inside the battery, the electrons feel a potential difference between the different poles of the battery. This potential difference imparts energy into the electron, causing it to jump to a higher orbital. It then travels through the atoms in the wire until it reaches the resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the resistor, energy is taken out of the electron. The electron jumps to a smaller orbital, and in the process it releases a photon. This release of a photon means it has given off energy. The photon, having energy, is converted to work and waste.</p>\n\n<p>The electrons, now occupying a smaller orbital, exits the resistor with less energy.Because their energy is smaller, their voltage drops. And this, I think, is the reason why it is called a <strong>voltage drop</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This answer raises the question, though -- how does a voltmeter detect this voltage drop, if it occurs in the orbital shells of an atom? And the answer is interesting: it doesn't. At least, not directly.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can read, what voltmeters do is measure the deflection of a pointer against a spring. The pointer, in turn, is moved by the repulsive forces of the electrons on a pivoting wheel inside the voltmeter. And the repulsive forces is, of course, directly proportional to the amount of energy inside the electrons. Because we know the equations of energy, all this is calibrated. What the voltmeter actually measures is not the voltage itself, but rather the force that the voltage difference exerts on the pointer of the voltmeter.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say much more on how the voltmeter works. I'm frankly not so sure if that's true, but I know that the moving current with a certain voltage must work in some way like I just said.</p>\n\n<p>When the electron comes back home to the cathode (because we're thinking in terms of actual electrons moving, rather than the conventional electron holes moving), its voltage will not be zero, but rather will be equal to the energy per eletron in the cathode. Kirchoff's law tells us that at every load, the voltage difference decreases due to the voltage drop. Because the electrons still have energy inside the cathode, this doesn't mean the voltage is zero there (causing electrons to have no energy, which intuitively makes them have no momentum, which can't be true). It just means that the energy when the electron comes back is now the same as the energy at the cathode, so there is no more potential difference and the journey of the electron stops.</p>\n\n<p>If I've made any glaring errors here (and I'm bound to have, as most of this is me guessing and trying to make sense of what I know), please feel free to edit me. And if I mis-explained something, please point out where in a comment, so I and everybody else can see where it's wrong and why. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I realize I used voltage in two ways here: the difference in potential between two points, and the energy per unit charge. One definition requires two points to be defined, whereas one requires only one point.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can reconcile this by imagining that there is the same voltage everywhere. Each electron has exactly the same amount of energy. In such a case, there is no voltage difference. There is no potential difference, meaning there is no gradient which will cause the electrons to move.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess I'm saying, voltage can be a point quantity, whereas the potential difference, or voltage difference, requires two points to be defined. Certainly, this is consistent with the definitions of voltage (and as I remember in class, voltage by itself is a scalar, so it only requires itself to be defined, not another point; the gradient or difference is what requires another point).</p>",

From the first part of the quote, it can be understood that therefrom follows that 'a cone is composed of many breaks and protrusions like steps'.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying problem here is that math doesn't talk about the real world. </p>\n\n<p>Suppose we have a function <em>d : [0, 10] \u2192 R</em>\u00A0 with \u00A0<em>d(h) = h</em>\u00A0 for the diameter of the cone on a specific height. Then cutting the cone on height <em>h<sub>1</sub></em> would mean looking at <em>d' : [0, h<sub>1</sub>]</em> \u00A0 and \u00A0 <em>d'' : (h<sub>1</sub>,10]</em> \u00A0 (note the open-closed interval here), where again <em>d'(h)=h</em> \u00A0 and \u00A0 <em>d''(h)=h</em>. Surely the highest point of <em>d'</em> is not equal to the lowest point of <em>d''</em>: <em>d'</em> includes <em>h<sub>1</sub></em> in the domain, while <em>d''</em> doesn't. </p>\n\n<p>However, the conclusion Democritus draws from this, that 'a cone is composed of many breaks and protrusions like steps', is incorrect: the function <em>d</em> is a smooth function.

I have 2 tins of blue how many yellow? Students often say that's easy just double the tins of yellow because you have doubled the blue. Now I ask them if I had 1000 blue or something like they say 500 but this time because they recognise there are $frac{1}{2}$ the number of blue. A subtle change but one that recognise the proportion of blue and yellow is the same for equivalent ratios. Hope this helps.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>While grinding metal, sparks are produced because of <strong>Friction</strong>. The rotating grinder cuts through the metal molecules, rubbing against them and producing heat. Some particles get loose in this process and burn because of this heat.</p>\n\n<p>From Wikipedia, \"<em>Steel is an alloy of iron, with carbon being the primary alloying element, up to 2.1% by weight. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements, their form in the steel either as solute elements, or a precipitated phases, retards the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and so weak, and so it controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Steel gets its strength because of the carbon impurities in its lattice. So obviously, Steel is much more stronger than Iron. Aluminium on the other hand is even softer and lighter than Iron, so there's even lesser friction and hence, lesser sparks. There is also the point about rusting and Aluminium does not rust. Though I am not sure if this is directly related to the production of sparks.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>So, by your definition, you want not just a Ghost, but an Apparition: a Ghost with visible, recognizable humanlike presence.</p>\n\n<p>The XBox story was my first thought, too.</p>\n\n<p>This could indeed be a virtual one, a recording of them as in the XBox story, or even an AI, a learning system that has acquired their skills and behaviors at least in the very specific domain in which it is designed to learn.</p>\n\n<p>In the XBox case, rather than merely driving like they drove on their last lap, a learning system could drive like the drove on average, displaying random of their driving quirks; or could drive as they did at their best <em>on each stage</em> of the race, thus driving better in sum than they ever did in life.</p>\n\n<p>A recorded video of someone, projected, would also work. If holograms are possible, then you have the Star Wars \"Help me, Obi Wan Kenobe, you are my only hope!\" - a ghost of a living person perhaps. Otherwise, you can project onto a wall, or more mysteriously, a stream of smoke, mist, cloud, or water. Could also be a computer-generated sprite texture-mapped with the person's face. Particularly with a low-fidelity projection onto a vague mist, the computer-generatedness would not be so apparent.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other ways to record a person's passing. Perhaps, as they walked from a clearing, they swiped at the thick leaves, and in doing so, either deliberately or accidentally hacked out a person-shaped hole, which, when the sun sets in the evening and shines through it, illuminates the spray from the waterfall. Doesn't even have to be a hole anyone's hacked out - but more likely if done as a deliberate thing. Since the sun moves slowly, you could have it so that only when the light from the sun lit a crystal at a certain angle, it refracted to become a projector - that way you could limit it only to a few minutes, or even a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>One effect I've seen that caused much consternation was headlights over a hill, which, because of the angle of the road, would shine in the back of a ruined house: the house would look lived in, for a moment, and then would fall dark again as the car moved on. Headlights on hilltops have also caused any number of UFO sightings. So, they make good brief-unexplained-lightings. If a picture is briefly lit by headlights passing outside, and the figure in it appears to because the shadows cast on the picture move, that could be a convincing \"ghost\" effect. Lightning could have a similar effect.</p>\n\n<p>Another good effect is a moon-halo. Here's a good trick. When the moon is close to full and dew lies upon the grass, look at your shadow: you will be surrounded by a halo. Tell your friend \"Wow, there's a halo around your shadow!\" (as if you see the halo around <em>his</em> shadow, and not your own) and the odds of him thinking there's something mystical about himself are quite high. When you stand above a mist-covered valley, and your shadow is cast onto the mists below, that has the same effect, writ large. So in this way, someone could be convinced into thinking they see, perhaps, their own ghost, or at least an outline, with a glow from their spirit?</p>\n\n<p>Double-exposure is possible, too: taking shots with a film exposed some years ago that you did not know had already been used to shoot someone else, would show them as ghosts in the shots. Similarly for a videotape with an erase/record head that did not fully wipe the previous data, perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>For more modern digital tech, it would take some kind of software bug - or a virus/malware/joke app that would impose another character into existing video.</p>\n\n<p>In realtime, augmented reality apps like google goggles or yelp's equivalent, let you point your phone at things and see signs for places nearby, etc... what is there was software on your phone that meant, when you pointed your phone camera at something, you say your dead friend superimposed in the shot, or perhaps just their face overlaid over nearby faces that the camera software identified?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><em>Wow, what a great range of answers! Thanks everyone who has answered so far and I hope to see many more! Here's my take, after a half-day of on-off thought (also set up a few servers in-between):</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uploading</a> never worked. It turned out that creating a new memory-association-chain in a human brain involved a holistic effort by the entire brain, and the complexity of the process defeated the best human minds for centuries on end. All it did manage to create was an abomination, a sad simile, incapable of true consciousness, of genuinely remembering new experiences, or of adapting to new environments. A failure. </p>\n\n<p>With time, a new practice evolved, of decorating the crypts, cemeteries and cities of the dead with these holographic and magnetic-force-field projections of those no longer living, based on such partial uploads. Some were only triggered by specific actions, such as placing flowers in a particular vase in the crypt, or rippling the water in a still, crystal-clear pool, while some only activated on the anniversary of their death. The varieties were endless.</p>\n\n<p>As this became more accepted, and the projections were no longer seen as abominations, the practice grew in scope. After the massive blast that took out the Andromeda Gateway and the surrounding great city of Carston, surviving friends and relatives recreated a distorted, slowly evolving projected replica of the entire city and its millions of inhabitants from records of the town and of the people, all on top of the overgrown ruins. As a monument.</p>\n\n<p>On the <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8453/massive-murderous-destruction-also-manportable\">fierce battlefields</a> of the future, people's life-recorders sometimes survived the blast that killed their owners, and, left on the desolate and temporarily radioactive wastelands, the life-recorders triggered and released a sad and confused ghost, forever retracing their last steps and random fragments of their life. Those with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPE</a> power-plates had a lifetime measured in tens of millennia. </p>\n\n<p>Slowly, as the gap between those embracing technology and those that didn't grew, the daring, the curious, the brave and the restless grew weary of Earth and embarked in <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9022/how-to-get-across-the-galaxy-moving-slower-than-light-in-a-single-lifetime\">great journeys across space</a>, leaving behinds an ever-more conservative, ever regressing Earth. The <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8866/where-to-anchor-my-space-elevator\">long elevators</a> were torn off their sockets and cast out into space. Things that were once known, were forgotten. The great underground oil, coal and mineral manufacturers trudged on for millenia, undoing the depleting work of many centuries and creating <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8716/sapience-pulsar-could-intelligence-come-in-waves\">new resources for a new dawn</a>. Eventually even these great machines froze in their tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>The ghosts, however, lived on amid the crypts and ruins of those majestic towns of an age long forgotten.</p>",

Important points: This exercise is very useful for beginners, because they can force them to build up and then possibly move on to the heavier acceleration exercise to a rod or rack. Make sure that you're not swinging backwards back during execution. Do not use momentum during exercise and try to keep your body as straight as possible. With Stiff Legged Deadlift you especially train the back muscles and glutes.

Although the causal link between contaminated hands and infectious disease transmission is one of the best-documented phenomena in clinical science, several factors have recently prompted a reassessment of skin hygiene and its effective practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Vita Ultra</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Even with use of antiseptic preparations, which substantially reduce counts of hand flora, no reductions beyond an equilibrium level are attained. The numbers of organisms spread from the hands of nurses who washed frequently with an antimicrobial soap actually increased after a period of time; this increase is associated with declining skin health. In a recent survey, nurses with damaged hands were twice as likely to be colonized with S. hominis, S. aureus, gram-negative bacteria, enterococci, and Candida spp. and had a greater number of species colonizing the hands.</p>",

Put all of that together with the dry ingredients and bake.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I tried doing something a little bit different. I've been making caramels, so I kind of experimented with my sugar.\nNew Method: Melt sugar until it becomes a syrup, then add hot melted butter until it becomes homogeneous. Add the eggs, chocolate and put them together with the dry ingredients. This time, the batter looked really good. It was nice and thick.</p>\n\n<p>This time the brownies did not become oily. They were good and fudgy.</p>\n\n<p>My question..does anybody melt their sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients in? I know that for Italian meringue and buttercreams, it is a necessity to melt the sugar, but for brownies? I don't know. It worked for me.</p>",

The r and w are the usual read and write permissions.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I use on Ubuntu/Apache, but I believe that it's also possible to do the same with the user (SUID).

The other caveat is that if your drive is mounted with the nosuid flag set, none of this will work.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetocrystalline_anisotropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnetocrystalline anisotropy</a> is all about spontaneous magnetization. Considere a (single domain) ferromagnetic material. Depending on its crystal structure, its spontaneous magnetization will tend to be aligned with a direction that minimize the interaction energy between magnetic dipoles carried by the atoms contained in one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">unit cell</a> of the lattice.</p>\n\n<p>That's why, depending on the geometry of the lattice system, you will have different types of magnetic anisotropy : uniaxial (one single easy axe), cubic (2 axes, one easy and one hard), tetragonal, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the most common anisotropy one can meet is the uniaxial one, that is particulary useful for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner%E2%80%93Wohlfarth_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stoner-Wohlfarth model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how about when an external magnetic field is applied? Well, there are two kind of energies in competition : the anisotropy energy which is minimum when the magnetization is along the direction of the easy axis, and the Zeeman energy which is the interaction energy between the magnetization and the external field. This situation is well described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model and consists basically in minimizing the energy of the ferromagnetic system :\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi)=K\\sin^2\\theta-\\mu_0M_sH\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)\n$$\nThe first term is the anisotropy energy ($\\theta$ being the angle between the easy axis and the magnetization, and $K$ the anisotropy strength), the second correspond to the Zeeman energy ($H$ is the norm of the applied magnetic field and $\\phi$ the angle that it forms with the easy axis).</p>\n\n<p>For convinience, let be $\\phi=\\pi$ fixed as an example. Then the energy $\\mathrm{E}$ has to be minimize according to the variable $\\theta$. In dimensionless units, one have :\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{K}\\,\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi=\\pi)=\\sin^2\\theta+2h\\cos\\theta\\quad\\text{with}\\quad h=\\frac{\\mu_0M_sH}{2K}\n$$\nOne can easily find the equilibrium states $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ by computing $\\partial_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})=0$ :\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\equiv\\{0,\\pi,\\theta_h=\\arccos(h)\\}\n$$\nand then study their stability by looking at the sign of the quantity $\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})$, namely :\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=0)=2(1-h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\pi)=2(1+h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_h)=2(h^2-1)\n$$\nThe take home message here is that it is possible to change the stability of the different equilibrium solutions by varying the magnitude $H$ of the magnetic field, i.e. by varying $h$. By changing $h$, one can actually <strong>flip</strong> the magnetization from one equilibrium orientation to another.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>We recently took over IT duties at a local law firm and have to deal with their neglected server. It's running SBS 2011 SP1 with the standard fare: AD, file shares, IIS, Exchange, and WSUS. From its installation in 2011/2012, it sat untouched until we took over.</p>\n\n<p>The main issue we're having is with Windows Update. It finds a few updates, downloads them (instantly, since it's the WSUS server), and installs them (pretty much instantly, which is very weird). Says everything was successful. When it checks for updates right after, it finds the SAME updates and you can go through this process an infinite amount of time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are no error codes generated.</li>\n<li>Those updates do not show up under \"Installed updates\" for removal.</li>\n<li>They do show up under the \"Update History\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've tried the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stop services, rename \"SoftwareDistribution,\" start services</li>\n<li>Stop services, move stuff out of \"Catroot2,\" start services</li>\n<li>Stop services, remove \"Catroot2,\" start services</li>\n<li>Combinations of the above all at once</li>\n<li>Try directly from Microsoft Update instead of WSUS</li>\n<li>Try with another administrative account</li>\n<li>Update Readiness tool - CheckSUR (no errors)</li>\n<li>FixIt for resetting Windows Update</li>\n<li>Check permissions on SoftwareDistribution, Catroot2, Registry entries</li>\n<li>Install updates manually - acts like it installs successfully, but it doesn't</li>\n<li>Uninstall the whole WSUS package, delete stores/DB, reinstall, reconfigure (they only have a handful of users/PCs which are mostly up-to-date)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, before I waste any more time, can I get the opinion of the collective minds of /r/sysadmin before I go crazy?</p>\n\n<p>For the record, the 4 updates that are showing right now are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>IE 11</li>\n<li>KB2871997</li>\n<li>KB2872339</li>\n<li>KB2882822</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also strange, there should be a LOT more updates showing. Exchange service packs (on SP1 I believe), Anti-Spam filter updates, Office updates, the gamut of security patches and update rollouts, etc. There is no way that in 2 years of going without updates or maintenance that I'm only missing a handful.</p>\n\n<p>If logs would be helpful, let me know what is needed.</p>",

What did you mean?<br>\n  Virgil Oldman: When simulating another's work the forger can't resist\n  the temptation to put in something of himself. Often it's just a\n  trifle, a detail of no interest. One unsuspected stroke, by which the\n  forger inevitably ends up betraying himself, and revealing his own\n  utterly authentic sensibilities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, in everything fake there is something real.</p>\n\n<p>Now, remember Claire's words that Rush replayed in his mind during the ending scenes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If anything should ever happen to us, I want you to know that I do\n  love you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the end of the film, Rush moves into the room furnished to his specifications, overlooking the square. This was the only place Claire mentioned as ever feeling safe and comfortable.</p>\n\n<p>By taking the apartment and going to the restaurant, he is showing hope that she will one day return - which is why he tells the waiter he is waiting for someone.</p>\n\n<p>He is hoping she is the glimmer of truth in the massive forgery. He has lost everything and is a broken man - but he is clinging to hope that that one part of his life could be real.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is another interesting issue to be discussed. Do the asylum scenes take place <em>before or after</em> the restaurant scene?</p>\n\n<p>There is no correct answer to this. Perhaps he was in the asylum and reflected on the events, as the movie showed, during his time there and found some glimmer of hope and waited in the restaurant. Or perhaps he waited in the restaurant, became more and more broken and ended up in the asylum.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, it's up to the viewer.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Ok, I have a strange issue. Besides appearing randomly, I finally experienced that also when I manually edit my server (VPS) (i.e. adding a domain) it modifies the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file. Only this time it needed a server reboot to have the issue though.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that modification my server directly replies with 'server not found' for every domain installed on the server, including those of clients. I need to manually remove the code it adds to that file- reboot the server and then everything is working properly again. I, of course, want to find the thing causing this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely, the edit to the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file has nothing to do with the changes made. It changes the vhost configuration for two domains; <code>iscs.nl</code> and <code>verboonhoveniers.nl</code>. Below is the regular configuration (in the file)</p>\n\n<pre><code># DOMAIN: iscs.nl\n<virtualhost *:80>\nServerName iscs.nl\nServerAlias iscs.nl www.iscs.nl\nServerAdmin zadmin@localhost\nDocumentRoot \"/var/zpanel/hostdata/zadmin/public_html/iscs_nl\"\nphp_admin_value open_basedir \"/var/zpanel/hostdata/zadmin/public_html/iscs_nl:/var/zpanel/temp/\"\nphp_admin_value suhosin.executor.func.blacklist \"passthru, show_source, shell_exec, system, pcntl_exec, popen, pclose, proc_open, proc_nice, proc_terminate, proc_get_status, proc_close, leak, apache_child_terminate, posix_kill, posix_mkfifo, posix_setpgid, posix_setsid, posix_setuid, escapeshellcmd, escapeshellarg, exec\"\nErrorLog \"/var/zpanel/logs/domains/zadmin/iscs.nl-error.log\" \nCustomLog \"/var/zpanel/logs/domains/zadmin/iscs.nl-access.log\" combined\nCustomLog \"/var/zpanel/logs/domains/zadmin/iscs.nl-bandwidth.log\" common\n<Directory />\nOptions FollowSymLinks Indexes\nAllowOverride All\nOrder Allow,Deny\nAllow from all\n</Directory>\nAddType application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ \"/_cgi-bin/\"\n<location /cgi-bin>\nAddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl\nOptions ExecCGI -Indexes\n</location>\nErrorDocument 500 /_errorpages/500.html\nErrorDocument 510 /_errorpages/510.html\nErrorDocument 403 /_errorpages/403.html\nErrorDocument 404 /_errorpages/404.html\nDirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.php index.asp index.aspx index.jsp index.jspa index.shtml index.shtm\n# Custom Global Settings (if any exist)\n\n# Custom VH settings (if any exist)\n</virtualhost>\n# END DOMAIN: iscs.nl\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, whenever I edit the server (i.e. add domain) it adds the following piece of code just before the closing tag <code></virtualhost></code>, right after `# Custom VH settings (if any exist).</p>\n\n<pre><code># Configuration for WebMail - webmail.yoursite.tld\n    <VirtualHost *:80>\n    ServerAdmin webmaster[at]yoursite.tld\n        DocumentRoot \"/etc/zpanel/panel/etc/apps/webmail\"\n        ServerName webmail.yoursite.tld\n    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php3 .php\n        <Directory />\n        Options FollowSymLinks Indexes\n        AllowOverride All\n        Order Allow,Deny\n        Allow from all\n        </Directory>\n    </VirtualHost>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm running on Ubuntu 12.04.

		"Body" : "<p>Going in a slightly different direction: don't go overboard. Most small-time prisons probably have a few minor defenses against spellcasters. They'll have their stuff taken, they'll be behind iron bars, if the jailor expects them to be spellcasters he\u00B4ll wear earplugs and hang the key on a 20 pound weight so it can't be Mage Handed and it\u00B4ll probably be dark, which makes vision targeting hard. Other than that; maybe a double set of doors with different keys, so that a single charm won't help, and a number of guards with orders to kill anyone who tries anything funny.</p>\n\n<p>If you go above and beyond this kind of thing for a general kind of prison, then you are basically unfairly targeting wizards. Most Wizards, especially the kind that you'd find in a low-level prison, will be contained by the above. If they try anything funny, they get stabbed to death by the guards. Most would probably not even <em>try</em> to escape. For every guard you charm, there's 5 more with pointy weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: many characters have a glib tongue and can talk their way out of a prison. We don't go around asking \"how do you keep a silver tongued rogue in prison?\". We don't ask \"How do you keep a barbarian who can bend the bars in prison?\", even though they probably can when in a Rage.</p>\n\n<p>If the wizard is high level and in a small-town prison <em>he will be able to escape.</em> So will any other high level character put in that situation; it's not a Wizard problem as much as it's a high level character vs low level challenge problem.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course when it comes to special anti-powerful-wizard-prisons, you can go all out, but those are fantastical locations, not simple buildings designed to hold not so powerful people.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>My favorite way to kill a fly is with a salt fly gun.  (Google those words and you will see what it looks like.)  It looks like a toy shotgun or rifle.  You cock it and when you pull the trigger it blasts a small amount of salt at the fly.  However, if you don't have a fly swatter you might not have a fly gun either.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how you kill the fly, one thing that may help is to immediately close the door of whatever room you are in. Cutting down on where the fly can go will allow you to kill is more easily.  It is also helpful, if you can shoo in into another room, to pick a room that contains lighter colors.  It is very difficult to see a fly against a dark background.  With the door(s) closed and a clear view of the fly you may then be able to search around for something to hit it with, whether it is a shoe, a rolled up newspaper, or whatever.  If you are feeling adventurous, try killing it with your hands, either by clapping your hands as it flies between them, or batting it out of the air to stun it, and then finish it off before it recovers.</p>\n\n<p>If the fly is on something you don't want to damage (for instance, as vase or trinket), try picking up the object from behind and then moving it towards your hand.  I actually killed a fly like this recently.  The fly won't sense the movement of your hand as easily as your hand is not moving.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Frankly, in the world that 5e has set up it would be difficult at best if you are not using the standard methods of restraining.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of an elite prison built for mages, guards that guard them would need earplugs to avoid any enchantment, and some form of hand/finger restriction would be necessary (manacled to their back with gauntlets that restrict any finger movement). Only the best trained guards in the village or trained animals should guard them (if druids, nix the animals). Trade guards out as frequently as possible to ensure no complacency. Most of the time a mage is unlikely to have Knock memorized, so it is unlikely to be used. Obviously those performing B&E are exceptions as would likely be an Arcane Trickster.</p>\n\n<p>They would, of course, need to be stripped of gear and given prison rags to wear.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, you have most of the ways listed above, but guard quality and restricting their actions when not actively working as slave labor (common among prisoners) would do the trick. </p>\n\n<p>Treat them <em>very</em> badly as well... The paranoid are going to ensure they never get a short rest (if warlocks are common), let alone a long rest. They should be performing demanding physical labor to keep them exhausted, sure. Slap them around a bit. It's a harsh world and those worried about spell casters that actually know about what they can do would take serious precautions.</p>\n\n<p>In FR, it would be easier to find a spellcaster to restrict the inmate than a magic item, so using spell casters to stop them would be helpful, but using a high level caster to stop an entire prison's worth of inmates would be a bit ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, Forest Gnomes are resistant to most of the spells that might cause a guard a direct problem, then they just have to be vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that when it comes down to it, they can't stop everything and eventually a caster is likely to find a way to escape if they had any memorized/known spells that might help at all and they are tenacious about it. It makes the game more dynamic and interesting when a dedicated criminal can get away with an escape.</p>\n\n<p>The last method is a very quick trial leading to execution for misuse of magic.</p>",

The origins of this practice are not certain - it is not, as is sometimes postulated, a remnant of Old English's grammatical gender (in Old English, a ship, or \"scip\", was neuter, and a boat, or \"b\u0101t\", was masculine).<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>It is currently in decline (though still more common for ships, particularly in nautical usage, than for countries), and in Modern English, calling objects \"she\" is an optional figure of speech, while in American English it is advised against by <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have also heard vehicles other than ships personified and feminized, though this is as often as not done derisively \u2013 for when a man spends so much time working on or driving a treasured car that it is referred to as his girlfriend or wife, and so is a <em>she</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But in all cases, this is not <strong>grammatical</strong> gender, it is supposed to be the <strong>actual</strong> gender of the thing that you're referring to. \"Man\" isn't a \"masculine noun,\" it's a \"noun which refers to a male.\" Even in cases where <em>she</em> or <em>her</em> are applied to inanimate objects, that is because those are objects are being <strong>personified</strong> and <strong>feminized</strong>,  not because the nouns themselves are in any way feminine. When, say, \"liberty\" is referred to with <em>she</em>, the speaker is referring to some \"Lady Liberty,\" liberty incarnate in the form of a woman (and sometimes, Lady Liberty might <em>literally</em> be a woman in a work).</p>\n\n<p>Grammatically, <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> can be swapped at will, and it will not cause a sentence to become ungrammatical \u2013 just confusing because it will be difficult to be sure to whom the pronoun refers. English has no grammatical gender.</p>",

If you use /usr/bin/bash, presumably you'd like the mini-script to use it also. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>\"$@\"</code> is a shell idiom for \"interpolate all my arguments, quoting them if needed\". This peculiar syntax causes</p>\n\n<pre><code>script.sh 'my file' your\\ file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to interpolate the arguments as two elements</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my file\" \"your file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of the four that <code>$@</code> would yield</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my\" \"file\" \"your\" \"file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The last lines of the script arrange for a gnome-terminal to start running the mini-script and then starting an interactive shell. When the gnome-terminal exits, the temporary script is removed because littering is uncool.</p>\n\n<p>The last line is not a part of the mini-script, it demonstrates that the mini-script works. If the 11 line script above is in a file called <code>rt.sh</code> then the <code>chmod</code> makes it executable and then it is executed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ chmod +x rt.sh && ./rt.sh echo hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result of all of this will be a gnome terminal which starts up, displays</p>\n\n<pre><code>hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on its first line and then starts an interactive shell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>msw@myhost:~$\n</code></pre>",

I seriously think the focus on BOTH questions is wrong; You need to fix your user problem, not the server filesystem problem. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, given how crucial this filesystem is to the basic functionality of the machine, your best bet is to get out of thinking about this problem like a sys admin and start thinking about it like a manager. </p>\n\n<p>In other words: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Teach your users how to properly reboot this system to prevent the /var corruption problem to begin with. Documentation is your friend as they say. This is not an ideal solution for multiple reasons but at least it keeps them from frying filesystems. If nothing else, they shouldn't be touching the damn thing at all if it's your job to keep it running. </li>\n<li>Lock it away where they can't get to it. Seriously, if this is a server storing important data why is this not already the case? Is this a development system and the developers just don't know what they're doing or how damaging this can be ?? If so, again, teach them. It's not your job to fix stupid, it's your job to prevent stupid. </li>\n<li>Tell them to leave it the hell alone and come talk to you if there's problems. :)</li>\n<li>Lo-tech, but possibly helpful (though a fire hazard to be sure): Duct tape the shit out of both ends of the power cable so they have to spend 15 minutes trying to untape it. Hopefully, after five minutes and on layer 26 of tape they'll get frustrated and do what they're supposed to do: Talk to you to fix the actual problem that's motivating them to pull the plug in the first place. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is it about this machine that makes it so unstable they think it's necessary to reboot it ?? It's a debian system. They don't need \"reboots\", so what else is wrong with it ?? Are they worried about power consumption or are there services that are broken and unstable on it that only a reboot can solve ? If it's the latter, then your question is irrelevant and you have other work to do, sorry to say. </p>\n\n<p>If nothing else, you could approach your suggestion to be good to it and not reboot by pulling the cable as an exercise in energy conservation. Do you really want to get up from your desk to pull a power cable rather than just sit there, login, and reboot it on the command line ?? It takes like 2 seconds of work to do it that way, versus getting up, grumbling the entire time all the way to the device, yank the cable, plug it back in, wait for it to come back up broken, and then have to wait even longer for /var to be fscked. </p>\n\n<p>The get up-yank cable-wait for /var to fix it self cycle takes far longer, is far more complex to maintain in the long run, will cause all kinds of pain on your part, has already motivated you to ask the wrong questions, and will ultimately lead to you at the top of a bell tower with a love weapon and a death wish. </p>\n\n<p>Fix it right, by fixing your users or mitigate the damage by making it extremely challenging for them to accomplish stupid. I can't be more clear on the importance of this. </p>",

		"Title" : "Good question. \n\nIn the context of the first few chapters of Proverbs, t...",
		"Body" : "<p>Good question. </p>\n\n<p>In the context of the first few chapters of Proverbs, the compiler of the proverbs makes it very clear the book had its genesis in the throne room of Israel. Picture King David  carving out some quality time with one of his children, Solomon, for the express purpose of teaching his son some of the lessons he has learned over the years. David, you'll recall, was a \"man after God's own heart\" (Acts 13:22; 1 Sam 13:14), and he learned many things in his relationship with his God, some the hard way. </p>\n\n<p>David's purpose, then, was to instill in his son Solomon the godly principles which would guide and guard him throughout his life and his future reign as king of Israel. The pithy and memorably constructed proverbs of the day served to encapsulate important life-lessons in short, relatively easy-to-memorize stanzas. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, at about the same time as Solomon was composing, <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Ecclesiastes+12\" rel=\"nofollow\">pondering, searching out, and arranging many proverbs (perhaps 3000 or more</a>), Amenemope had already written his <em>The Wisdom of Amenemope</em>, a collection of teachings in proverb form on civil service, which may have predated Solomon's collection of proverbs. Some of Solomon's proverbs bear a striking resemblance to some of Amenemope's aphorisms (see the <em>NAS Bible, Updated Edition</em>, Introduction to Proverbs, under \"Author\"). These \"family resemblances\" suggest Solomon searched all the proverbs to which he had access in his day and \"cherry picked\" the ones which suited his purposes (and God's purposes, of course!)  </p>\n\n<p>Since an important theme of the entire book is sexual morality and the importance of young people (particularly the male of the species; i.e., guys) keeping their lives free from the polluting effects of unprincipled and unbridled sexual activity, Solomon chose a woman to personify wisdom to serve as a righteous counterpart to the \"immoral woman\" who appears and reappears throughout the book. She is alternately labeled \"the evil woman,\" \"an adventuress,\" the \"flattering foreigner,\" an \"adulteress,\" and perhaps many other titles, depending on which version of Proverbs you happen to read. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the <strong>evil woman</strong> serves as a foil** for the <strong>woman who is wisdom personified</strong>. Or, they act as foils for one another, as the contrast between the two serves to clarify the differences between them. One woman, for example, is out to bring a young man to ruin, whereas the other woman has only his best long-term interests at heart. One represents immediate gratification followed by regrettable consequences, and the other, delayed gratification followed by gifts that keep on giving. Contrast, for example, the adulteress who is mentioned throughout the book with another woman, this time <strong>the virtuous woman</strong>, who is described in detail in chapter 31!</p>\n\n<p>Was the personification of virtues a common feature of literature in Solomon's day? Frankly, I do not know. I will leave the answer to that question to another contributor who desires to research it. I will say, however, the Scripture does use \"stock characters\" who serve in pedagogical/analogical fashion to drive home some hortatory content (e.g., the \"story\" of two women--again!!--called Oholibah and Ohola, in Ezekiel 23). </p>\n\n<p>Female imagery is used in both positive and negative ways throughout the Scripture. Positively there are both the woman Wisdom who lifts up her voice in Proverbs 8 and the \"virtuous woman\" in Proverbs 31, and negatively there are both the Great Harlot (or \"Babylon the Great,\" of John's Revelation of Jesus Christ), and the </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"woman clothed with the sun, [with] the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars . . . who gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . . .\" (Rev 12:1,5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Great Harlot serves as a foil for the pregnant woman who gives birth to a son.</p>\n\n<p>Solomon's choice of a woman to serve as wisdom personified may have been his own invention, or perhaps he borrowed the concept from Amenemope or another writer either from or before his time. <em>That</em> he used a woman for his pedagogical purposes is certainly consistent with other such rhetorical tactics in Scripture, as I have already pointed out. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, you will notice I have connected the woman wisdom to other personifications which use women to communicate certain truths, and I have done so purposely, in part, to avoid eisegesis. While your question focuses on the Book of Proverbs, the Scripture comprises 66 books, and more than occasionally the imagery which is used in one book or context is also used in another book or context, giving the Scripture a marvelous unity amidst diversity. That fact, however, is one which is worthy of development, albeit at another time.  </p>\n\n<p>**For an interesting (and short) article on the use of foils, see this <a href=\"http://characterandcharacterization.webs.com/foil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">web page</a>.</p>",

You see, we always expect everything to be as we like it. We want to have control over all around us, even nature. In Christian theology, the earth is at the center of the universe. Our inherent conception is that we occupy a central, priveleged position in everything we do, from relationships to businesses to our understanding of the universe. The reality is that we are anything but priveleged. Science has repeatedly shattered this misconception of ours, but we still hang on to the ego. I suggest you watch Carl Sagan's famous speech <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZRF6zNoc\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Pale Blue Dot</em></a> which puts accross this message so powerfully. </p>\n\n<p>In such a case, I think it is extremely unfair to expect the speed of light have a value that appeals to us, other than $c$, the universal speed limit. In your case, the question is not about why the speed of light has that particular value, but why we think it is not supposed to be so.</p>",

I do sound design for video games. I <em>always</em> prefer non-edited files even if they require some extra work.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I find a very nice sound to fit my project but disappointed to see it was ruined because somebody assumed that it is better to add some fancy FX so that the sound would fit some genre in their mind (not mine) perfectly and everybody will love their SFX library. So I'm left with an \"if it was unedited it would be very useful sound\" with a strange reverb and 3 seconds of fade out on it.</p>\n\n<p>Let's check what the <em>Library Producer</em> <a href=\"http://sound.stackexchange.com/a/34272/12636\">says</a> about that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't have context. I'm giving you all of the clean sound that was in the air in that moment, and relying on you to use that sound as you see fit in your project. If I were to do a fade that I might like, you'd be cursing me for that the moment my fade didn't match your context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you do a lot of sound design work you get used to and small clean up requires just a little effort which definitely worths rather than searching for a similar sound although you already have the ruined version of a perfect fit.</p>\n\n<p>I think edited libraries are mostly fast-food libraries for people looking for some quick work that doesn't need or doesn't have budget for a sound design job.</p>",

		"Title" : "No, Jesus did not subject Himself to the law of the land by paying the t...",
		"Body" : "<p>No, Jesus did not subject Himself to the law of the land by paying the temple tax. </p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the temple tax (see Exodus 30:12 ff.) was <em>not</em> a law of the land, but it was a law of Moses imposed on the \"sons of Israel\" both as a ransom for them and for the maintenance of the \"tent of meeting\" (i.e., the tabernacle).</p>\n\n<p>By paying the temple tax Jesus was avoiding unnecessary controversy and at the same time not offending the collectors of the tax, who were within their rights to do so (again, see Exodus 30:12 ff.). </p>\n\n<p>We do well, however, to follow Jesus' line of reasoning for doing so, and the logic he used with impetuous Peter who took it upon himself to speak for Jesus when asked if his teacher (i.e., Jesus) paid the two-drachma tax. <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Matthew+17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is what Constable says about this passage:</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Jesus turned this inquiry from the tax collector into a teaching situation for Peter and presumably the other disciples. Jesus changed the tax from a religious one to a civil one to make His point clearer. The principle is the same in both cases, but it was easier to illustrate in the civil arena of life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jesus\u2019 point was that [just] as the sons of kings are exempt from the taxes their fathers impose, . . . He [too] was exempt from the taxes His Father imposed. He meant the temple tax. The temple really belonged to God (Mal. 3:1). Jesus was teaching Peter the implications of His deity. <em>He was not teaching Peter to fulfill his civic responsibility</em> [my italics].</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Even though He was exempt, Jesus would pay the tax because He did not want to offend anyone needlessly (cf. 5:29). Failure to pay the tax would create unnecessary problems. Because Peter was one of Jesus\u2019 disciples and one of God\u2019s children through faith in Jesus, he also had no obligation to pay the temple tax (cf. 12:1-8) . . .. Since the sons of God are exempt from maintaining the temple and its service, the end of this system of worship appeared to be approaching, as it was. Here is another indication that Jesus ended the Mosaic Law (15:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus' paying of the temple tax for both himself and Peter was not an instance of Jesus subjecting himself to any law, whether imposed by the state or by God through Moses for Israel. Rather, paying the tax was a teaching opportunity through which he taught his disciples about his deity and specifically about his relationship to the Law and to the Law Giver. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is said that no one is above the law. No one, that is, except the Law Giver.  Some of Jesus' most memorable words began with the phrase, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You have heard that it was said, . . .. But I say unto you . . ..\" (see Matthew 5:21 ff.), </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and yet, the same Jesus also said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Do not think I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17 NASB Updated). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Christians thank God that though Jesus was above the Law, he also came to fulfill it perfectly for those of us who could not.  </p>",

		"Title" : "Design a system for real time events delivery",
		"Body" : "<p>Please share your thoughts over this designing question (If you need any more info, pls. do let me know): GIVEN: Let's say we have a popular eCommerce site with lots of sellers and millions of products. The system has a CatalogManager Service which is being called by various seller platforms to update info (attributes) about seller and it's products. For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.</p>\n\n<p>TO DESIGN: There are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'. Other example, SearchService must be notified that 'Hey, Seller S1 brand name has changed to New_Brand' so that it can change it's index to be searched.</p>\n\n<p>Design such a system which can scale & is fault tolerant ensuring all edge cases including one mentioned below:-</p>\n\n<p>Every back-end service may not be interested in all the events. It may only wish to listen subset of attributes. E.g. ShippingService may only want if product dimension related attributes change. So how will you ensure that only related messages reach to consumer services?</p>\n\n<p>How will you ensure that event message published by producer service (CatalogManager) reacheed to the related consumer service for sure and in REAL TIME?</p>\n\n<p>How can you ensure the messages passed to backend services are in sync (in order it's important)</p>\n\n<p>How to ensure that same event is not messaged twice to the consumers?

		"Body" : "<p>From what I understand, unless such as in the 3.5e example where the cantrip or spell specifially says the cantrip or spell can be executed in conjunction with an attack, that itself IS an attack or action.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if you read the 3.5e version of the cantrip you posted, it says you do a <strong>melee touch attack</strong> to do the fire damage, it does <strong>NOT</strong> mention doing the damage in addition to any bludgeoning damage from a martial arts unarmed attack for instance. So I think it's either/or and cannot be combined, you have to choose which one you are performing.</p>\n\n<p>In 5e, an unarmed attack is undescribed (except perhaps by the player flourishing his action with story telling). The monk could be hitting with a open hand, fist, elbow, knee, head, kick, or <strong>EVEN</strong> with weapons that qualify as monk's weapons (simple weapons). You'd be hard pressed to explain how the flame traveled from the palm of your hand along the shaft of the staff.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, mages can use staffs, rods and wands in touch attacks can't they? I don't have a ready reference to check that for 5e. There is a discussion here <a href=\"http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/46704/can-the-arcane-druidic-focus-staff-double-as-quarterstaff\">Can the Arcane Staff Double as a Quarter Staff</a> about this particular question. It's a bit more broad than your specific question, but may just be part the answer you are looking for by answering whether a staff can double as a quarter staff and THUS be treated for touch when part of an unarmed attack sequence. I don't think it will grant additional damage, but it COULD allow your cantrip to cause 1-6 fire damage rather than 1d4 bludgeoning. I think that would still have questionable effect though since the amount of damage is rather comparable once all bonuses are taken into account, the principle difference being between bludgeoning vs fire damage. I also still don't have my PHB with me, but monks get a elemental discipline called something like <strong>Fangs of the Fire Snake</strong> or something like that that grants 10 ft reach and 1d10 fire damage <strong>in addition to</strong> your bludgeoning damage.</p>\n\n<p>I'll update that monk discipline later when I get home.\nEDIT: Updated Discipline</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>You should pay attention to your singing.</p>\n\n<p>Tone-deafness is a result of a disconnection between what are you hear and what you produce. It is generally fixable through conscious attention.</p>\n\n<p>I work developing musical training computer games for children.</p>\n\n<p>My mother sang to me as a child, and she is tone-deaf. I also learned to sing in a tone deaf manner. We learn by copying.</p>\n\n<p>I subsequently spent thousands of hours playing the piano, but my early training (basically to NOT pay attention to the sounds I am making) retarded my musical development. That caused me much suffering.</p>\n\n<p>It was only in my 30s that I trained myself consciously to sing correctly, it has been hard work. I taught myself to sing accurately using a solfege system.</p>\n\n<p>I fixed such things as gradual pitch drift, incorrect intervals such as getting a fourth, fifth, octave muddled up, squashed thirds.</p>\n\n<p>It is a blessing for your child that you are conscious enough to enquire.</p>\n\n<p>You should find your child a teacher, who can teach them to sing. This should be the first instrument everyone learns upon, it is our natural inbuilt instrument. To try and bypass it is stupid. Chopin said <strong><em>\"If you wish to play, you must first learn to sing.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If your child has a teacher, you don't need to worry about damaging their musicality.</p>\n\n<p>If the child doesn't, you do. Even by abstaining from singing, your child will learn to perceive the world as you do by a million subtle cues. The way you use words, the way your eyes will move, the way your physical form follows conscious intent. And the set of conditions that led to your own disconnection may well be transferred to the child. Maybe you are primarily a visual person, this is your primary perception and the root of your attention. It's quite easy to see if someone is primarily a visual person. The renowned 19th century music teacher Evelyn Fletcher Copp (the first teacher to systematically impart Absolute Pitch to her child students) said that when a parent brought a prospective new student to see her, she would look closely and ascertain how the child perceives the world (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, logical, emotional, etc).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth remembering that these balances can be adjusted. Imbalance can show proclivity which is to be encouraged. But at the same time weaknesses should be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is strongly primarily visual, maybe practising music in a pitch dark room would encourage them to rebalance.</p>",

But for us programmer types who have to do sysadmin stuff out of necessity here's what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>Short answer: My MAC address was incorrect in my /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192 configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Long explanation: VMware generates a new mac address for each new virtual nic when you provision a new VM from a template. Seems reasonable. But when you look at the hardware address configured in the VMWare setting it only shows you the first four octet in a disabled text box that will not allow you to see the rest. My mac address in the configuration seemed to have the same first four octets so I assumed incorrectly that the mac address in the config was correct. After shutting down the VM, I could scroll to the right and see the rest of the mac address. Upon noticing it was different, I changed it in my config and everything worked.</p>\n\n<p>If Redhat devs read this site, please put some meaningful error messages when things like this go wrong.

		"Body" : "<p>We are using Windows Backup on SBS 2008 SP2 and backing up to 1TB external hard drives. Recently after switching drives our backup started failing because the backup drive is full and auto-delete isn't automatically deleting older backups/show copies. I'm trying to get more information to help me effectively prevent this problem from reoccurring in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How I can tell that the drive is getting full:</strong><br>\nIn the event viewer under Windows Logs > Application, I'm seeing Event ID 517 but it fails to show an intelligible description. However, under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Backup > Operational, I'm seeing an event with the ID of 5 and a description like this: Backup started at '10/4/2011 12:30:12 PM' failed with following error code '2147942512'.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most informative posts I've found on this error is located on Microsoft's Technet Forums <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsbackup/thread/c55e4e16-22af-4d84-b2c4-7aedcf512469\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In that post, a Microsoft representative gives this hazy explanation:</p>\n\n<p><em>auto-delete feature to ensure that at least some old backup copies are maintained on the disk -- does not automatically delete backups if space utilization by older copies is less than 1/8 of the disk size or in other words, 13% of the disk size. that means if the one full backup copy does not fit in the 7/8 of the disk size, backup may fail with disk full error. auto-delete will not automatically delete older versions to reclaim more older versions of backup.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the above explanation, I do not understand what is meant by \"older copies\" except that it appears that anything older than the very last shadow copy would be considered \"older copies\". I'm going to make the assumption that this problem where auto-delete will not work will affect any hard drive that is large enough to make an effective backup drive, or in other words, any hard drive that is large enough to hold more than one backup/shadow copy at once.</p>\n\n<p>The same MS representative proposes the solution of using a larger backup drive. I can't understand how this will help. It appears to me it will simply delay the problem until a later date.</p>\n\n<p>In order to resolve this problem for now, I did the following: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Assign the backup drive a disk letter under disk management. </li>\n<li>Run the command line with Administrative rights.</li>\n<li><em><strong>diskshadow.exe</strong></em> [enter]</li>\n<li><em><strong>delete shadows oldest x:</strong></em> [enter] (where X: is the letter you\nassigned your backup drive)</li>\n<li>I manually ran the above command some 60 or 80 times to free up about 200 GB of space on my 1 Terrabyte External Hard drive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, I do not feel this is a satisfactory solution to prevent the problem from happening again in the future. <strong>Does anyone have a solution to prevent your Windows Server backup drive from getting full?</strong></p>",

		"Body" : "<p>While the two are related,  the amount of time you spend doing workouts for your muscles is not necessarily the way to build bigger muscles. Though you clearly need to work out if you expect your muscles to grow larger, if the size of your muscles was solely based on the time you spent using them, then marathon runners, cashiers and bus boys would easily have the largest muscles. Muscle growth is about repetition with resistance and nutrition. The first stage the workout is what provides your muscles with their initial size. As you perform repetitions with heavy weights, your muscles start to expand because new muscle cells are making your tissues expand. However, once your workout is over, those new muscle cells start to slowly die because your body has used up its nutrition. This causes that same muscle growth to start to contract. That is why the sooner you can heal those cells by eating foods high in amino acids  the more of the cells you can save before they die, because amino acids are the key ingredient towards healing dying cells.strongmenmuscle is-no2-maximus-scam-or-fake/</p>",

If the group is not set, the default user's group\n;       will be used.\nuser = joeri\ngroup = admins\n\n; The address on which to accept FastCGI requests.\n; Valid syntaxes are:\n;   'ip.add.re.ss:port'    - to listen on a TCP socket to a specific address on\n;                            a specific port;\n;   'port'                 - to listen on a TCP socket to all addresses on a\n;                            specific port;\n;   '/path/to/unix/socket' - to listen on a unix socket.\n; Note: This value is mandatory.\nlisten = 127.0.0.1:9003\n\n; Set listen(2) backlog. A value of '-1' means unlimited.\n; Default Value: 128 (-1 on FreeBSD and OpenBSD)\n;listen.backlog = -1\n\n; Set permissions for unix socket, if one is used. In Linux, read/write\n; permissions must be set in order to allow connections from a web server. Many\n; BSD-derived systems allow connections regardless of permissions.\n; Default Values: user and group are set as the running user\n;                 mode is set to 0666\n;listen.owner = www-data\n;listen.group = www-data\n;listen.mode = 0666\n\n; List of ipv4 addresses of FastCGI clients which are allowed to connect.\n; Equivalent to the FCGI_WEB_SERVER_ADDRS environment variable in the original\n; PHP FCGI (5.2.2+). Makes sense only with a tcp listening socket. Each address\n; must be separated by a comma. If this value is left blank, connections will be\n; accepted from any ip address.\n; Default Value: any\n;listen.allowed_clients = 127.0.0.1\n\n; Choose how the process manager will control the number of child processes.\n; Possible Values:\n;   static  - a fixed number (pm.max_children) of child processes;\n;   dynamic - the number of child processes are set dynamically based on the\n;             following directives. With this process management, there will be\n;             always at least 1 children.\n;             pm.max_children      - the maximum number of children that can\n;                                    be alive at the same time.\n;             pm.start_servers     - the number of children created on startup.\n;             pm.min_spare_servers - the minimum number of children in 'idle'\n;                                    state (waiting to process).

If the number\n;                                    of 'idle' processes is greater than this\n;                                    number then some children will be killed.\n;  ondemand - no children are created at startup. Children will be forked when\n;             new requests will connect. The following parameter are used:\n;             pm.max_children           - the maximum number of children that\n;                                         can be alive at the same time.\n;             pm.process_idle_timeout   - The number of seconds after which\n;                                         an idle process will be killed.\n; Note: This value is mandatory.\npm = dynamic\n\n; The number of child processes to be created when pm is set to 'static' and the\n; maximum number of child processes when pm is set to 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'.\n; This value sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be\n; served. Equivalent to the ApacheMaxClients directive with mpm_prefork.\n; Equivalent to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment variable in the original PHP\n; CGI. The below defaults are based on a server without much resources. Don't\n; forget to tweak pm.* to fit your needs.\n; Note: Used when pm is set to 'static', 'dynamic' or 'ondemand'\n; Note: This value is mandatory.\npm.max_children = 10\n\n; The number of child processes created on startup.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Default Value: min_spare_servers + (max_spare_servers - min_spare_servers) / 2\npm.start_servers = 4\n\n; The desired minimum number of idle server processes.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'\npm.min_spare_servers = 2\n\n; The desired maximum number of idle server processes.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'dynamic'\n; Note: Mandatory when pm is set to 'dynamic'\npm.max_spare_servers = 6\n\n; The number of seconds after which an idle process will be killed.\n; Note: Used only when pm is set to 'ondemand'\n; Default Value: 10s\n;pm.process_idle_timeout = 10s;\n\n; The number of requests each child process should execute before respawning.\n; This can be useful to work around memory leaks in 3rd party libraries. For\n; endless request processing specify '0'. Equivalent to PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS.\n; Default Value: 0\n;pm.max_requests = 500\n\n; The URI to view the FPM status page. If this value is not set, no URI will be\n; recognized as a status page. It shows the following informations:\n;   pool                 - the name of the pool;\n;   process manager      - static, dynamic or ondemand;\n;   start time           - the date and time FPM has started;\n;   start since          - number of seconds since FPM has started;\n;   accepted conn        - the number of request accepted by the pool;\n;   listen queue         - the number of request in the queue of pending\n;                          connections (see backlog in listen(2));\n;   max listen queue     - the maximum number of requests in the queue\n;                          of pending connections since FPM has started;\n;   listen queue len     - the size of the socket queue of pending connections;\n;   idle processes       - the number of idle processes;\n;   active processes     - the number of active processes;\n;   total processes      - the number of idle + active processes;\n;   max active processes - the maximum number of active processes since FPM\n;                          has started;\n;   max children reached - number of times, the process limit has been reached,\n;                          when pm tries to start more children (works only for\n;                          pm 'dynamic' and 'ondemand');\n; Value are updated in real time.\n; Example output:\n;   pool:                 www\n;   process manager:      static\n;   start time:           01/Jul/2011:17:53:49 +0200\n;   start since:          62636\n;   accepted conn:        190460\n;   listen queue:         0\n;   max listen queue:     1\n;   listen queue len:     42\n;   idle processes:       4\n;   active processes:     11\n;   total processes:      15\n;   max active processes: 12\n;   max children reached: 0\n;\n; By default the status page output is formatted as text/plain. Passing either\n; 'html', 'xml' or 'json' in the query string will return the corresponding\n; output syntax. Example:\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml\n;\n; By default the status page only outputs short status. Passing 'full' in the\n; query string will also return status for each pool process.\n; Example:\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?json&full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?html&full\n;   http://www.foo.bar/status?xml&full\n; The Full status returns for each process:\n;   pid                  - the PID of the process;\n;   state                - the state of the process (Idle, Running, ...);\n;   start time           - the date and time the process has started;\n;   start since          - the number of seconds since the process has started;\n;   requests             - the number of requests the process has served;\n;   request duration     - the duration in \u00B5s of the requests;\n;   request method       - the request method (GET, POST, ...);\n;   request URI          - the request URI with the query string;\n;   content length       - the content length of the request (only with POST);\n;   user                 - the user (PHP_AUTH_USER) (or '-' if not set);\n;   script               - the main script called (or '-' if not set);\n;   last request cpu     - the %cpu the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because CPU calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n;   last request memory  - the max amount of memory the last request consumed\n;                          it's always 0 if the process is not in Idle state\n;                          because memory calculation is done when the request\n;                          processing has terminated;\n; If the process is in Idle state, then informations are related to the\n; last request the process has served. Otherwise informations are related to\n; the current request being served.\n; Example output:\n;   ************************\n;   pid:                  31330\n;   state:                Running\n;   start time:           01/Jul/2011:17:53:49 +0200\n;   start since:          63087\n;   requests:             12808\n;   request duration:     1250261\n;   request method:       GET\n;   request URI:          /test_mem.php?N=10000\n;   content length:       0\n;   user:                 -\n;   script:               /home/fat/web/docs/php/test_mem.php\n;   last request cpu:     0.00\n;   last request memory:  0\n;\n; Note: There is a real-time FPM status monitoring sample web page available\n;       It's available in: ${prefix}/share/fpm/status.html\n;\n; Note: The value must start with a leading slash (/).

If this value is not set, no\n; URI will be recognized as a ping page. This could be used to test from outside\n; that FPM is alive and responding, or to\n; - create a graph of FPM availability (rrd or such);\n; - remove a server from a group if it is not responding (load balancing);\n; - trigger alerts for the operating team (24/7).\n; Note: The value must start with a leading slash (/). The value can be\n;       anything, but it may not be a good idea to use the .php extension or it\n;       may conflict with a real PHP file.\n; Default Value: not set\n;ping.path = /ping\n\n; This directive may be used to customize the response of a ping request. The\n; response is formatted as text/plain with a 200 response code.\n; Default Value: pong\n;ping.response = pong\n\n; The access log file\n; Default: not set\n;access.log = log/$pool.access.log\n\n; The access log format.\n; The following syntax is allowed\n;  %%: the '%' character\n;  %C: %CPU used by the request\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{user}C for user CPU only\n;      - %{system}C for system CPU only\n;      - %{total}C  for user + system CPU (default)\n;  %d: time taken to serve the request\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{seconds}d (default)\n;      - %{miliseconds}d\n;      - %{mili}d\n;      - %{microseconds}d\n;      - %{micro}d\n;  %e: an environment variable (same as $_ENV or $_SERVER)\n;      it must be associated with embraces to specify the name of the env\n;      variable. Some exemples:\n;      - server specifics like: %{REQUEST_METHOD}e or %{SERVER_PROTOCOL}e\n;      - HTTP headers like: %{HTTP_HOST}e or %{HTTP_USER_AGENT}e\n;  %f: script filename\n;  %l: content-length of the request (for POST request only)\n;  %m: request method\n;  %M: peak of memory allocated by PHP\n;      it can accept the following format:\n;      - %{bytes}M (default)\n;      - %{kilobytes}M\n;      - %{kilo}M\n;      - %{megabytes}M\n;      - %{mega}M\n;  %n: pool name\n;  %o: ouput header\n;      it must be associated with embraces to specify the name of the header:\n;      - %{Content-Type}o\n;      - %{X-Powered-By}o\n;      - %{Transfert-Encoding}o\n;      - ....\n;  %p: PID of the child that serviced the request\n;  %P: PID of the parent of the child that serviced the request\n;  %q: the query string\n;  %Q: the '?' character if query string exists\n;  %r: the request URI (without the query string, see %q and %Q)\n;  %R: remote IP address\n;  %s: status (response code)\n;  %t: server time the request was received\n;      it can accept a strftime(3) format:\n;      %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z (default)\n;  %T: time the log has been written (the request has finished)\n;      it can accept a strftime(3) format:\n;      %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z (default)\n;  %u: remote user\n;\n; Default: \"%R - %u %t \\\"%m %r\\\" %s\"\n;access.format = %R - %u %t \"%m %r%Q%q\" %s %f %{mili}d %{kilo}M %C%%\n\n; The log file for slow requests\n; Default Value: not set\n; Note: slowlog is mandatory if request_slowlog_timeout is set\n;slowlog = log/$pool.log.slow\n\n; The timeout for serving a single request after which a PHP backtrace will be\n; dumped to the 'slowlog' file. A value of '0s' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_slowlog_timeout = 0\n\n; The timeout for serving a single request after which the worker process will\n; be killed. This option should be used when the 'max_execution_time' ini option\n; does not stop script execution for some reason. A value of '0' means 'off'.\n; Available units: s(econds)(default), m(inutes), h(ours), or d(ays)\n; Default Value: 0\n;request_terminate_timeout = 0\n\n; Set open file descriptor rlimit.\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_files = 1024\n\n; Set max core size rlimit.\n; Possible Values: 'unlimited' or an integer greater or equal to 0\n; Default Value: system defined value\n;rlimit_core = 0\n\n; Chroot to this directory at the start. This value must be defined as an\n; absolute path. When this value is not set, chroot is not used.\n; Note: you can prefix with '$prefix' to chroot to the pool prefix or one\n; of its subdirectories. If the pool prefix is not set, the global prefix\n; will be used instead.\n; Note: chrooting is a great security feature and should be used whenever\n;       possible. However, all PHP paths will be relative to the chroot\n;       (error_log, sessions.save_path, ...).\n; Default Value: not set\n;chroot =\n\n; Chdir to this directory at the start.\n; Note: relative path can be used.\n; Default Value: current directory or / when chroot\nchdir = /\n\n; Redirect worker stdout and stderr into main error log.

This can\n; prevent configuration mistakes on the web server side. You should only limit\n; FPM to .php extensions to prevent malicious users to use other extensions to\n; exectute php code.\n; Note: set an empty value to allow all extensions.\n; Default Value: .php\n;security.limit_extensions = .php .php3 .php4 .php5\n\n; Pass environment variables like LD_LIBRARY_PATH. All $VARIABLEs are taken from\n; the current environment.\n; Default Value: clean env\n;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME\n;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin\n;env[TMP] = /tmp\n;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp\n;env[TEMP] = /tmp\n\n; Additional php.ini defines, specific to this pool of workers.

		"Body" : "<p>I'm going from the UK to Merate, Italy next month. I'll be flying into MXP and really don't fancy driving, so I booked an advance train ticket to get me from Malpensa Aeroporto to Cernusco-Merate. So far, so good! EDIT: I'm taking the Malpensa Express into Milano and then a Regionale train out to Merate. I booked through Italiarail.com.</p>\n\n<p>However, when I received the information on how to pick up my tickets, it included a note which seems to imply that all the self-service ticket pickup kiosks in Italy are out of order and that I have to visit a larger Trenitalia station before I travel, where an assistant will print out the ticket for me. Because I won't be in Italy at all before I want to travel, I may have an interesting time trying to get my tickets. For information, <a href=\"http://www.italiarail.com/ticket-pickup-instructions\" rel=\"nofollow\">a page of ticket pickup advice from the train booking website</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone here experienced this Italian train ticket pickup problem first hand? Can someone who has first-hand experience explain to me what is going on with the kiosks, how long you'd expect to wait, and why there's no warning before you book that you can't easily collect these tickets?</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to know exactly what the situation is so that I can alter my plans accordingly. If it becomes too much hassle, I will probably just attempt to get a refund and buy a ticket on the day.</p>",

So I'm looking for a kit with many options. Anything extra you could recommend would also be appreciated (I'm hoping to make my own laser tag gun & receiver along the way) </li>\n<li>Like many people, I'd like to understand what's going on to some extent. Not so much that I would need a B.E in electrical engineering, but... well, as much as possible (I still don't know what's a realistic goal). Would the material in \"All about circuits\" cover most of what I'd need to get to a high level?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'd also like to hear from your experience learning electronics (If you learned from a book/All about circuits). I assume some books try to skip the math as much as possible (though I have no way of knowing, which is why I'm looking for recommendations). I don't mind the math, though I don't have a physics background. For now, I'm willing to get back into some intermediate level calculus/linear algebra if that's what it takes.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>The current version of pickadate as a module only exposes the instance of PickerConstructor but it doesn't expose DatePicker neither TimePicker so every time we try to instantiate a date picker or time picker we got the error <code>undefined is not a function</code> because neither of them have been loaded and so no <code>jquery.extend</code> invocation have been made to append them to the jQuery object.</p>\n\n<p>What is needed is some kind of facade / wrapper to expose all the pickadate functionality out of the box.</p>\n\n<p>For this I made some small changes directly to the pickadate code base. I added an <code>index.js</code> that works as the facade / wrapper for <code>picker.js</code>, <code>pick.date</code> and <code>pick.time</code>, allowing them to be used out of the box with Browserify by issuing the typical <code>require('pickadate')</code>. It doesn't need to be assigned to a variable since pickadate attaches itself directly to the jQuery object. You can check <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mogarick/edfe96cb0a7682996c1d\" rel=\"nofollow\">this gist with the <code>index.js</code> code I used</a></p>\n\n<p>This change is a copy of the way the CryptoJS library by @evanvosberg exposes its different algorithms through the same pattern implemented in its <code>index.js</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>The only additional change would be to modify the property <code>main</code> in pickadate <code>package.json</code> to point to <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I've just send a message to @amsul, the <a href=\"https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">pickadate</a> author asking for the possibility of integrate this changes directly into the pickadate github repo.</p>\n\n<p>I hope people trying to use pickadate with browserify can find this solution and stop getting frustrated trying to make them play well together!</p>\n\n<p>Greetings to everybody!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>For context, I am a forty-something male from the Great Lakes region of the United States.  I work full-time as something other than a writer.</p>\n\n<p>About 25 years ago in high school, I was an almost-straight-A student.  The \"almost\" was always due to English class.  I hated, nay despised, the writing assignments I was given, believing the forced topics to be inane and worthless.  Whenever I had to write an essay or research paper in another class, I could do just fine, thank you.  I didn't need to compare and contrast the points of view of the boy in the story we had read with that of his father, as an example.  Who cares?</p>\n\n<p>My reason for mentioning this is that any previous answers I've heard to questions like this were along the lines of \"your teachers at school\" and \"your supervisor/ co-workers.\"  But I am long out of school and failed to recognize the resources at the time, and my workplace involves no creative writing whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>So now, I find myself with a couple of neat stories inside my head begging to be let out.  I have also been diverting increasing amounts of my \"hobby time\" to sitting at this computer and typing out bits and pieces of these stories.  When I review my own work, I know when I've written something bad, and can redo it.  But I'm less confident in when I've written something really good, like maybe-I-could-publish-it-good.</p>\n\n<p>I've got some characters, scenes, and dialogues I think are ok.  But I also have some weak transitions, plot holes, and other minor issues I just can't seem to be able to tweak.</p>\n\n<p>Where can I go, or who can I speak with, to read bits of my work, give me some friendly advice and constructive criticism?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I'm experimenting with a MOSFET that controls power to another component so that I can remove all current from it when it's not in use and save power. In regards to that, this question is awesome: <a href=\"http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/18884/switching-dc-with-mosfet-p-channel-or-n-channel-low-side-load-or-high-side-loa\">Switching DC with MOSFET: p-Channel or n-Channel; Low Side Load or High Side Load?</a></p>\n\n<p>But I'm running into some snags when it comes to practical use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>First approach:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2K28G.png\" alt=\"schematic\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p><sup><a href=\"/plugins/schematics?image=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f2K28G.png\">simulate this circuit</a> \u2013 Schematic created using <a href=\"https://www.circuitlab.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CircuitLab</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I was able to switch this off fine, but when it was on, I was only getting half voltage out. Turns out I was using an N channel MOSFET wrong, and it's not good as a high side switch like this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideas to fix:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I could move the MOSFET to GND</strong> of the LED array with a 100 ohm resistor on the gate. I believe this would allow it to act like a switch in the manner that I really want. However, the addressable LEDs still draw a decent amount of power when their GND is disconnected! It seems the return path goes down the CLK and DAT lines. This is not a problem when VCC is disconnected. This means I would need three MOSFETS, one for each of CLK, DAT and GND, driven by one pin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I could use a P-Channel on the high side</strong>, but to turn it off I need to supply voltage. When turned off, I want to be conserving power with the micro controller in a super low power mode . In that state wasting current holding the MOSFET closed seems wasteful, and I'm not the micro controller could do that in sleep mode.</p>\n\n<p>Both those options seem kind of inelegant. What I seem to need is a simple 4 pin component (VCC, GND, GATE, OUTPUT) that can connect VCC and OUTPUT when I pull GATE high. Does such a thing exist?</p>\n\n<p>What do you think is my best bet for making this work with the fewest/simplest components?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>OK Mo'ne Davis is a horrible example.  Chances are she doesn't grow at all and her fastball hits 75 mph max.  Many 13 year old girls are fully grown, height-wise.  I have personally been around 2 very athletic girls that were very similar to her - one as an umpire and another I personally coached.  The girls at 13 are just more mature than boys of that age psychologically and developmentally.  Boys hit their growing spurt around 14-15.  So girls have two years in school that they might be faster or more talented in the strength/speed sports.  [Actually 4 years ago one of my boys played against a 12 year old girl in football that was laying kids out.  She is talented and will probably have multiple big-time college offers for 2-3 sports but you would laugh if she had football pads on now.  She's 5-8 120 pounds... almost the same size as when she played football]</p>\n\n<p>I want a disclaimer to my answer in that I am pretty strict what I consider a sport.  Auto racing, board games, and strategy games are not sports to me.  I personally feel that bowling is not a sport (but a great game) and golf is right on the lowest fringe of sport.</p>\n\n<p>Do women have a chance?  Well not anytime soon.  They just don't have the physical attributes that will help them, unless they start altering their physical attributes.  I remember my college (large D1 school) having the WNBA players stay in the dorms over the summer.  I was on the basketball practice team.  Was probably at the level of a DIII starter but nothing great.  We would play the WNBA girls daily.  My team would include 1-2 guys from practice squade and 2-3 \"good\" pickup players. </p>\n\n<p>In their three weeks there the WNBA players never won a game.  They scratched, clawed, brought out their 6-7 big, it didn't matter.  They couldn't stop our first step or the power drive.   Number don't lie.  We won probably close to 100 games.  Most of these girls were stars at big D1 programs.  We didn't hold back at all (mainly because they started playing dirty in game one) but we weren't also \"great\" players.  I believe all of the girls we played were better basketball players than us - fundamentals, shooting, tactic, positioning, whatever - but the athletic disadvantage was too much to make up.</p>\n\n<p>What sport are women closest to catching men?  I would think it would be the marathon.  Running that distance requires using your body's existing fat reserves.  Women have an advantage here.  They can possibly be lean and in race shape with more fat in their body.  </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I am trying to implement a FEM solver for the following initial value problem\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - \\nabla^2 u &= f\\quad \\text{ in } \\Omega\\times (0,T)\\\\\nu &= g\\quad \\text{ on }\\partial\\Omega\\times(0,T)\\\\\nu(x,y,0) &= u_0(x,y)\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$ is just a rectangular domain. The functions $f$ and $g$ can vary with time. I have discretized this IVP into\n$$\\mathbf{B}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{l} $$\nwhere\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{B}_{ij} &= \\int_\\Omega \\phi_i\\phi_j\\\\\n\\text{A}_{ij} &= \\int_\\Omega \\nabla\\phi_i\\nabla\\phi_j\\\\\nl_i &= \\int_\\Omega \\phi_i f\n\\end{align}\nand I can assemble these matrices and vector. I have also discretized time to get the time-stepping scheme\n$$(\\mathbf{B}+k\\theta\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = (\\mathbf{B}-k(1-\\theta)\\mathbf{A})\\mathbf{u}^n + k(\\theta \\mathbf{l}^n + (1-\\theta)\\mathbf{l}^{n+1}), $$\nwhere $\\theta\\in[0,1]$ and $k$ is the time-step.</p>\n\n<p>Here comes my problem. How exactly do I impose the boundary and initial condition, implementation-wise? What changes should I make to the matrices $\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{B}$, etc? Should I do anything at each time-step? I feel like it shouldn't be too hard, however when the time is introduced it suddenly confuses me.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I am trying to implement a natural language query preprocessing module which would, given a query formulated in natural language, extract the keywords from that query and submit it to an IR (information retrieval system) system.</p>\n\n<p>At first, I thought about using some training set to compute TF-IDF values of terms and use these values for estimating the importance of single words. But on second thought, this does not make any sense in this scenario - I only have a training collection but I dont have access to index the indexed IR data. Would it be reasonable to only use the IDF value for such estimation (is IDF enough to establish weight of a term in general)? Or maybe another weighting approach?</p>\n\n<p>Could you suggest how to tackle this problem? Usually, the articles about NLP processing that I read talks about training and test data sets. But what if I only have the query and training data?</p>",

They chose to define it as a player who establishes control of the ball, lands on the field, and then holds it for long enough to do something else. This something else is commonly referred to as a football move. </p>\n\n<p>This seems like a reasonable enough line to draw because if a player has the time and wherewithal to do something else, he's probably done catching the ball. If he doesn't, he's probably still in the process of catching the ball.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,\nEzra</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Have you tried the find it game? For my dog I often hide food caches (a small collection of kibble, or a medium sized treat) around the apartment for her to find. It's a fun 'puzzle' and since you decide where to hide the rewards, the difficulty level is adjustable. As my dog has gotten better at finding the hidden treats I've had to come up with more advanced places to hide them (inside old shoe boxes, underneath her dog bed...etc.) If you try this technique and your dog is already a bit destructive you might want to be extra mindful of where you hide the treats (so you're not encouraging your dog to destroy or mess up anything else)</p>\n\n<p>For a more high tech solution there are weird robot toys that play with your dog while you're away...something like this:  <a href=\"http://goifetch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://goifetch.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I want to add that one of the best ways to make your dog less restless while your away is to tire your dog out while you are around. A tired dog is more likely to want to lie around the house while you're away.\nGood luck :)</p>",

The Multi-server feature seems to be very limited, but it could be so much better with a little effort.  I figure it will be removed from the product one of these years, fixed, and then added back as a great \"new\" feature in the ENT edition.  </p>\n\n<p>I think the limitation is in the extended procs such as xp_msx_enlist code.  They determine the name of the local instance.  If it was T-SQL code, it might have been easier to fix.  As far as I can tell, the only place the target name is stored is in msdb.dbo.systargetservers table on the master server.  If the targets could be tricked into requesting a sync for the FSDN, then the table could have be updated (hacked) directly to use the FQDN.  </p>\n\n<p>If it was open source, it would have been fixed years ago.  It would have had more features by now too.  </p>",

As far as Terramorphous goes, the only legendary anything it has dropped has been slayer of terramorphous mods.....never anything else.  I have literally had better luck buying legendary weapons in vending machines than getting either of those to drop one.  I have seen chubby varkids drop a crappy launcher, chubby spiderants drop a shield that wasn't worth picking up..other than that, the only items I have seen drop have been slayer of terramorphous and that's all....gearbox really needs to do something about the shoddy drop rates.  I don't mean they should drop some legendary every time, but they should at least have a 5% chance of dropping SOMETHING besides crap items.  And by the way, I cannot play online so getting someone to \"dupe\" anything for me is out of the question...wouldn't want that anyway, no point in having it if I didn't get it myself</p>",

Video podcasts primarily go to the iPad and audio primarily to the phone, but when flying I often put audio podcasts on the iPad to save battery life on the phone.</p>\n\n<p>Then in iTunes I connect each device and use the settings for the device to control which podcasts and which playlists are synced to the device. I generally only sync checked files and I uncheck episodes after they are played.</p>\n\n<p>Also in iTunes on the MacBook Pro I have smart playlists for recently played and recently added and I use those to help me find the newer Podcast episodes quickly and to uncheck played episodes quickly.</p>\n\n<p>This is admittedly a lot of work. I spend a couple hours or more each week managing my playlists. I sync nearly every day to add new episodes and clean up old episodes. I just could never make the \"automatic\" sync'ing work the way I wanted, so I decided to take control of it with these techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Final Note: in iTunes Preferences on the Store tab, I turn off Sync Podcast subscriptions and settings. I have found there is a bug in this process that sometimes causes iTunes to stop downloading any podcasts. There was some discussion on the Apple Support Forums that pointed me to this change.</p>",

Meaning that as volatility increases the value of your position increases (holding everything else the same).  How much added value that you get for an certain increase in volatility (called vega) <a href=\"http://totaloptions.com.au/818/introduction-to-options-trading-option-vega/\" rel=\"nofollow\">depends on how in/out of the money the option is at currently</a> among other things, but if you own the call/put it is always positive as more volatility means more possible upside.</p>\n\n<p>When you sell calls or puts then volatility decreases are good for your position so you are called \"short\" vol.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I am currently dealing with the same thing, and have been for a while now. The comments are harsh judgements like you think the asker was given a parenting handbook and that the information provided here is something that only idiots and bad parents don't know. I hear child development and education backgrounds, maybe some psychology/behavioral health. YOU  should know this stuff, yes. Is it something that a normal run-of-the-mill parent should? No. Not unless they bury their face in books and can decide to agree with one of the many conflicting theories of \"good parenting\". </p>\n\n<p>Some of us have no \"good\" examples of how things are supposed to be done and are just trying to not make the same mistakes as our parents. The advice seems valid and well delivered but did it really have to be preceded by implicit scoffs and 'How could you be so stupid\"-like comments?</p>\n\n<p>Expectations are not set too high when you expect your child to do simple tasks without every day being an argument...for EVERY task.</p>\n\n<p>Well let me tell you. I have been dealing with my 10 y/o son not showing interest in ANYTHING and dragging butt about everything in his daily tasks. I have tried everything. I STARTED with explaining why it's important to brush teeth and take a good shower everyday. I asked the exact preferences that were listed here:</p>\n\n<p>\"Do you want to shower at night or in the morning?\" \n\"Do you want to brush your teeth before or after breakfast?\" \n\"Do you want to play for a little while before you start homework?\" \n\"How about after a snack?\"\n\"Do you want to do your homework at the breakfast bar or table?\" \n\"Do you think it would be easier to stay focused or more comfortable if you had a desk in your room? Let's try and see.\" </p>\n\n<p>I have provided encouragement, enforced consequences, provided positive reinforcement, and taken things away. We have time-outs for when either of us get frustrated and we both go to our own spaces to reflect and regroup. I have tried a LOT of different ways to skin this cat. What works for some does not ALWAYS work ALL of the time. I find that as soon as I find something that seems like it is working, it just doesn't and I have to change methods. That has been going on since he was 2 or 3. </p>\n\n<p>I also have an 11 y/o daughter. I have used the same parenting style with her from the beginning. She is autonomous, successful in anything she tries, and interested in everything. She is smart, has great friends, and has great confidence. Different cat.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with some of the comments is that they seem abrasive and sound condescending. Why not ask questions like:\n \"What kind of encouragement have you tried?\"\n\"Which tasks are the most difficult?\"\n\"Have you sat him down when not trying to get him to do something and just asked how he feels about each thing? Why does he think or feel like he does about fulfilling his responsibilities?\" \n\"There have been no \"diagnoses\" in the family but have you considered taking him to speak with someone anyway?\" </p>\n\n<p>Talking to someone that is trained to communicate with children can be helpful. Sometimes it is just an issue of parents not knowing how to communicate with their child. I am still trying to figure it out myself. Kids can be 10 different people by the time they reach double digits. </p>\n\n<p>I say (a couple of years too late) good job for caring enough to seek guidance. We don't have all of the answers and sometimes it takes the wisdom of the village to survive the parent-child relationship. That being said, the villager should be able to ask for the wisdom without feeling attacked. I understand that the asker may have not read the responses that way but I did. So may others that stumble upon this post. All I typed in the search engine was \"how to help my child find interests\". </p>\n\n<p>How about trying to build up or encourage the parent? Do we not still need it? Or, is it a good idea to criticize someone that may already be feeling less-than great about how they're doing in one of life's most challenging tasks? People don't grow out of needing support.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, my son has outgrown the fighting me on things. Most of the time he just complains and whines about everything or will do bare minimum at best without me staying on him. </p>\n\n<p>One thing to help with brushing teeth that parents can try is using the pre-rinse that stains the \"yuk\" on teeth so they see how they're doing. The first time they get it all off before you check is self-rewarding for them. Also, the timed electric toothbrushes help them realize how long it really takes. We use the Sonicare for kids by Phillips. It beeps every 30 seconds letting them know when to switch sections. They can pause it to spit and you can hear it go throught the cycle without having to watch them like a hawk. The vibration tickles for a few days but they get used to it. Another good thing about it is that if they don't put a lot of physical work into it, the toothbrush still gets the job done as long as they actually move it to each part. I'm not endorsing that specific brand, I just don't have knowledge of other brands' features. It is definitely more expensive than regular toothbrushes but for me, worth it in what I save at the dentist. Huge improvement in dental health after the switch.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Briefly, no.</p>\n\n<p>Charged particle interaction is fundamentally a non-instantaneous photon exchange. The interaction can be written or expanded as the ''naive'' instantaneous interaction ($e^2/r$) plus a photon exchange portion which contains exactly a $-e^2/r$ term and a non-instantaneous (retarded in time) term. The author calls the first term the Coulomb interaction, and he calls the second the photon interaction. (We note that the sum of these two results in the cancelling of the instantaneous $e^2/r$ term, giving us a time-dependent expression for charged particle interaction, as expected.)</p>\n\n<p>Then I think the author says that since distances are small, times are also small, and so the instantaneous Coulomb term dominates. Thus it is acceptable in most cases to use the naive 19th century Coulomb definition.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Edit2</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>I agree that the author is being very semantically confusing, and even contradictory.</p>\n\n<p>The author is using a loose definition of the word \"interaction\" (as was I, before this edit).\nStrictly speaking, the expression \"$e^2/r$\" does not describe an interaction, but rather just tells us the strength of the force. That is, it doesn't say at all <em>how</em> the force arises, it just describes the end result. (Note the analogy to Newtonian vs Einsteinian gravity.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus you would call it the Coulomb Law; \"Coulomb Interaction\" is something that does not exist, or has not yet been proposed (since it would be an instantaneous action-at-a-distance mechanism). As far as we know, all charged particle interaction takes place by exchanging photons. (You could call the exchange of photons the \"Coulomb Interaction\", but then there wouldn't be the distinction that the author makes.)</p>\n\n<p>The author is essentially trying to say that we can ignore the mechanism by which the charged particles interact, and study only the resultant forces and effects arising from their interaction.\nIt would be acceptable, in my opinion, to ignore that somewhat misleading paragraph of the text.</p>",

The original regular expression removed most of the line breaks, removed data labels, as well as a line labeled \"Ad Hoc\" which I elected to remove because it was not present in every file, so when I brought it into excel it would misalign the columns.</p>\n\n<p>After looking at additional text files that were the output of this database, I have discovered that there are more inconsistencies, so since I really only need 2 or 3 pieces of data from this, I think it would be easiest to remove everything except what is needed.</p>\n\n<p>I tried to use pipes (which I have come to understand is an \"or\" operator in regex) to try to add additional conditions to the expression, but once I added more than one additional condition it would start to skip the following conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my requirements, and below I will paste in example text:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I only need 2 data items from each document section: Document Handle and FileName.</li>\n<li>At the bottom of the text file there is an additional portion of the file path denoted by \"\\\"</li>\n<li>In some text files, filename and the path at the bottom are repeated, but are the same</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The text files which are the output of the document database we are using is pretty useless as it is.  My goal is to be able to pull something into excel which has the document handle and filename for each document (each section starting with \"BEGIN:\" is a separate document) and the complete file path at the bottom.  So far I have been using a semicolon to deliniate the text when pulling it into excel.</p>\n\n<p>Sample Text:</p>\n\n<pre><code>>>>>Self Configuring Tagged DIP<<<<\nBEGIN:\n>>DocTypeName: System

Something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private int jumpPointer;\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchDown(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if((x > (5*width)/7 && y < (2*height)/7)) {\n        controller.jumpPressed(); //make the character jump\n        jumpPointer = pointer;\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean touchUp(int x, int y, int pointer, int button) {\n    if (pointer == jumpPointer && Gdx.app.getType().equals(ApplicationType.Android))\n        controller.jumpReleased();\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Well, pointer is a bit oddly named in my opinion.  TouchIndex would probably have made more sense, especially with pointer having a pair of very well defined meanings already.  The pointer value is value between 0 and n (defined as 20 in LibGDX, in reality much lower) that represents the ORDER in which the touch event occurred in the event of multiple simultaneous touches.  Therefore if you have multiple fingers touching, a pointer value of 0 would indicate that this touch event represents the first finger to touch the screen, while a value of 3 would be the fourth finger to touch the screen.</p>",

		"Title" : "Like others have said, firewall, and if you feel it necessary IDS/IPS to...",
		"Body" : "<p>Like others have said, firewall, and if you feel it necessary IDS/IPS too.  But to me, it's the wrong question.  You need to address these things:</p>\n\n<h2>Forensics</h2>\n\n<p>Have you managed to work out how you were comprimised before?  If not, it would be a good place to start.  Knowing how your system ended up with a RAT on it in the first place means you can close off that door</p>\n\n<h2>Firewall</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned by a few others, firewall that stuff.  A box running two NICs and using   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall\" rel=\"nofollow\">UFW</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iptables</a> to filter traffic is a good start, although make sure that box is itself very locked down.  Consider whether you need to run each service on the firewall box too.  e.g. if it's in the same room as you, does it need SSH/telnet running, or can you just use it in person?</p>\n\n<h2>IDS/IPS</h2>\n\n<p>If you consider it necessary, you could even add an Intrusion Protection/Detection System to the box.  There are <a href=\"https://www.alienvault.com/blogs/security-essentials/open-source-intrusion-detection-tools-a-quick-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">several freeware tools</a> to consider in this regard.</p>\n\n<h2>System hardening</h2>\n\n<p>Both on the box you proxy through, and the box you develop on, consider some hardening.  Get a software firewall that is good for your OS, and antivirus for that OS too, and ideally some way to check regularly for Rootkits etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Good practices</h2>\n\n<p>More important than any of the above is to adopt good practices.  It's no good setting up a hardware firewall if you then open ports whenever something doesn't work, and forget to address whether they need to stay open, and it's no good installing a rootkit finder if you never run it.</p>\n\n<p>All of this said, base what you do on a risk assessment (useful to know how previous exploits worked for risk assessment, too), and don't go overboard.  You could spend a week building a nice little setup with custom hardware firewalls, IDS/IPS protection, hardware level AV, and all manner of other stuff, but if you'd do better with a simpler set up and spending that time working, consider whether that's a better idea.</p>\n\n<h2>Audit</h2>\n\n<p>Try and find a decent security audit tool for your system.  If you are running linux, I find <a href=\"http://www.nongnu.org/tiger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tiger</a> is pretty good, </p>\n\n<h2>Opportunism</h2>\n\n<p>The likelihood is that you weren't targeted.  Statistically speaking, people trying to make money out of security holes in a criminal way (like holding code to ransom) aren't seeking out particular individuals to exploit, but rather people who fit a certain demographic.  It's more likely that you were exploited last time because some script kiddie could find a dev server of some sort running or something like that, and was scanning for these particular things in order to perform the exploit on you that they did.  Your biggest aim is to make yourself hard to find and then target, as this is a much more likely scenario than a direct target of you and only you.  The other thing that makes me think this is that you were extorted for money, whereas a targetted attack would probably be trying to steal your code and keep it.</p>\n\n<p>Consider whether you may have been targeted, but I think on the whole, closing any security holes you can find will be a good first step.  I think you can probably avoid this problem again with just the firewall, but a lot depends on how you were comprimised.</p>",

Since the column count is on the high side (even though the max column count is 1000 i think 200 is high side) I can create a new table with the primary key columns and my new column or I can add the new column to the existing table. Which will be performance wise better. Which will be overall better design. If you can elaborate and lead me for more information it would be better. Thanks in advance.</p>",

Im not sure if its possible.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to export some animations to an .FBX file and in my animations I make use of blend materials that I animate, so that I have an animated texture.  </p>\n\n<p>How ever when I go to export the file to FBX the blend materials never make it through.  I always get the error:</p>\n\n<p>Some materials in this scene may not be supported by certain applications and will import as standard gray materials instead. The following materials are affected: \n    -Left_HemiSphere_Blend\n    -Right_Hemisphere_Blend</p>\n\n<p>Those 2 materials are 2 Blend materials that have 2 children each, those children themselves are just standard materials with a .jpg map attached to the diffuse.  </p>\n\n<p>I realize that not all applications support blend materials but if I then open the fbx file again in 3ds max, the materials are gone.  </p>\n\n<p>Is it not possible to bake or export the blend material information to an .FBX file from 3ds max? Or am I missing a step?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Answers to many questions about this theme doesn't help me! It's not the problem that audio needs to be started first by a click or any other type of action.</p>\n\n<p>I want to Play a number of different short mp3's on my website. The best approach I've found is the following. It works on Internet Explorer and Chrome (other Desktop browsers not tested) and on mobile devices with iOS. But not on Android.</p>\n\n<p>In my html I initialize an audio device:</p>\n\n<pre><code><audio id=\"mp3play\" src=\"\"></audio>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's only for defining the name \"mp3play\".</p>\n\n<p>In the header of the html I have the following javascript:</p>\n\n<pre><code><SCRIPT language=JavaScript> \n<!--\nfunction play(name) {\n        var oAudio = document.getElementById(\"mp3play\");\n        oAudio.stop;\n        oAudio.src = name;\n        oAudio.play();\n}\n\n//-->\n</code></pre>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Now I can invoke the player with the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('stuff/voc/WAVvow/011001.MP3');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works fine, even on Android.</p>\n\n<p>But for special requirements I do not use filenames for mp3's. I've made a Perl script to deliver the pm3 data depending on a computation. For this I use the following link:</p>\n\n<pre><code><a href=\"javascript:play('../cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004');\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This Perl code \"playmp3.pl\" sends a header and then the complete mp3 data:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ($entry[0] has a pointer to the desired data, $entry[1] the length)\n    open(DAT, \"<../wbtde/DictData/dv8.dat\");\n    binmode DAT;\n    seek(DAT, $entry[0], 0);\n    read(DAT, $mp3, $entry[1]);       # Lesen des Eintrages\n    close DAT;\n    print \"Content-type: audio/mpeg\\n\\n\"; \n    print $mp3;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this works fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browsers, but not on Android. </p>\n\n<p>I can invoke the script also directly with</p>\n\n<pre><code>www.mysite.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?185004\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also this is working fine on IE, Chrome and iOS browser, but not on Android. Android tells me it can not play this type of content. But with content type audio/mpeg3 it's also not playing.</p>\n\n<p>This is the Android error log when I tap one link only:</p>\n\n<pre><code>            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n            D/CDX_Player( 2402): >>>>>>>> CedarX Player Version: 00010707\n            I/CedarPlayerWrapper( 2402): setDataSource('http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013')\n            W/MediaPlayer(  967): info/warning (701, 0)\n            I/ChromiumHTTPDataSource( 2402): connect to http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/playmp3.pl?062013 @0\n            I/MediaPlayer(  967): Info (701,0)\n            D/sft_http_stream( 2402): reset stream\n            I/NuCachedSource2( 2402): ERROR_END_OF_STREAM\n            W/demux_http( 2402): unknown file format!\n            E/demux_http( 2402): open error, destroy stream handle\n            E/DemuxSftNetwork_Component( 2402): cedar demuxer open error\n            E/CedarXPlayer( 2402): CedarXPlayer:prepare error!\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): error (1, -2147483648)\n            E/MediaPlayer(  967): Error (1,-2147483648)\n            I/CDX_Player( 2402): cancel prepare!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another try:\nI've saved the output from Perl script to a file with the name \"test.MP3\".

The question was misconstrued.</p>\n\n<p>First, I traced the connection using WireShark, and at no point the server asks (need or  want) a certificate. However, VirtualCenter (VC) does provide a way to register a certificate as part of a connection and then use that certificate authenticate. For this to work, they provide a way to tunnel connections.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence I used is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First specify the URL to connect to as https://: (note the protocol is secure, but the port is not).</p></li>\n<li><p>The initial socket will be opened to the clear text port. But having https as the protocol will force calling my own SSLSocketFactory. In my socket factory, I get a call to my <code>public Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)</code> method, which allows me to convert my socket to SSLSocket to my taste.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>My code essentially looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\npublic Socket createSocket(Socket s, String host, int port, boolean autoClose)\n    throws IOException {\n    s.setKeepAlive(true);\n    String connectReq = \"CONNECT /sdkTunnel HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\";\n    OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());\n    writer.write(connectReq, 0, connectReq.length());\n    writer.flush();\n    // In this initial response, all that matters is the http code. If\n    // it is 200, the rest can be ignored.\n    READ_AND_VERIFY_INITIAL_RESPONSE();\n    SSLSocket sock = (SSLSocket) origSslSockFactory\n        .createSocket(s, s.getInetAddress().getHostName(), s.getPort(), true);\n    // Depending on whether the caller actually does the handshake\n    // or not, you may need to call handshake here. In my case, I\n    // did not need to, since HTTPClient I am using calls the\n    // handshake. Axis does not call, so you may have to in that\n    // case.\n\n    // sock.startHandshake();\n    return sock;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above block, origSslSockFactory is the SSLSocketFactory that got replaced by your implementation. In my case it was an instance of sun.security.ssl.SSLSocketFactoryImpl.</p>\n\n<p>After that procedure, calling ExtensionManager.setExtensionCertificate() succeeds. And subsequently, all calls to SessionManager.loginExtensionByCertificate() also succeeds. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to post this as there seem to be a lot of questions about this.</p>",

I think you all have good points, and the real answer to my question would be a combination of these.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: Economic or climatic (lack of ressources) pressures couldn't do the trick</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy point out above, these types of pressure can only force a population drop for a limited amount of time. Indeed when the humans are less numerous, then the pressure fades and restrained fertility rise again.<br>\nAs the population is spread on a lot of planets, the risk for a great catastrophe to kill enough humans at once to get passed the minimal amount for specie perpetuation is also really unlikely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>No: It's all about culture!</strong><br>\nAs @Mark remarks in his answer, even if the mainstream culture discourages having lots of children, in time it would be replaced by the subcultures with higher fertility rates.<br>\nEven if global human fertility is decreasing, (for w/e reason) the individuals from the fertile subcultures willing to have children will try everything in order to do so, and probably succeed thanks to advanced science. (in vitro fecondation and so on) As @Vincent points out, individuals mostly do see their interest before such things as their specie's destiny.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes: It would require intervention of a greater institution or entity</strong><br>\nAs @WorldSpinner and @Vandroiy emphasise, the only way to go past these barriers is to postulate that an extremely well informed and patient institution or entity works in the shadows to lower the overall fertility (using viruses or chemicals) and break the most fertile subcultures. (using manipulation)<br>\nI think we proved here that this is necessary as else evolution or fertile subcultures (that we can see as a social mutation towards specie surviving) would always take over.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Alternative possibility: coincidences</strong><br>\nThe only other way is if an extremely unlucky chain of coincidences happens. For example first the economic pressure makes couples less eager to procreate, then a few catastrophic events dynamite the most fertile subcultures, while a very hardcore sect takes over...<br>\nWith the dramatic combination of all these economic, climatic and cultural factors, humanity could end up being a very infertile and fanatic small group of individuals.</p>",

		"Title" : "MySQL replication error when an event is expired and dropped automatically",
		"Body" : "<p>I have an event that ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00, and a replication error was caused by <code>drop event ***</code> statement, coz the slave complains that the event does not exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>A little bit more background: we have about 10 MySQL master/slave pairs, each running independently, with identical config(all managed by chef). An event was created previously on all masters, and when the event expired, half of the slaves has a replication error, caused by the <code>drop event</code> statement, while the other half were fine. I checked with one pair of master/slave, both binlog and relay log shows there was a <code>drop event</code> statement at about 2014-01-21 10:06:00(the event actually ends at 2014-01-21 10:00:00), while the 'fine' ones seem not having the <code>drop event</code> statement at all.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-event.html</a>, the event is supposed to be immediately dropped once is has expired. </p>\n\n<p>So I did a simple test. First create an event on master, I can see both master and slave has this event, while the status of that event on the slave is 'SLAVESIDE_DISABLED', which is expected. </p>\n\n<pre><code>DELIMITER |\nDROP EVENT IF EXISTS `test_event` |\nCREATE EVENT `test_event`\nON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 MINUTE STARTS '2015-01-22 15:45:00' ENDS '2015-01-22 15:48:00'\n  DO BEGIN\n    insert into t values ();\n  END |\nDELIMITER ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At 15:48, the event on both master & slave was gone. I check the binlog and relay log, both show that there was a <code>DROP EVENT test.test_event</code> at 2015-01-22 15:48:00, which looks quite fine.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is: \n1. Among the 10 master/slave pairs, any idea why half the master did not execute <code>drop event ***</code> at all when the event expired, while the other half did, but late for several minutes, and the event on the slave is already gone(while a simple test worked just as expected)? Or where should I look at besides the binlog and relay log?</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>All events on the slaves are gone already, those without a replication error doesn't have the <code>drop event</code> statement in relay log at all. So how did those event gone in the first place?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>PS: MySQL version is 5.5.29-29.4-log Percona Server</p>",
