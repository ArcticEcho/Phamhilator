		"Body" : "<p>Magento Version 1.9 (the latest one)\nHosting OS: Linux technical</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changing memory limit:</strong> \nI contacted my domain host and they told me my php memory was 128M. However it was only possible to change it to 256M because of my hosting plan. Despite the change, the problem remained. </p>\n\n<p>I was able to reindex all of the things in the index management section, until yesterday. If you say that I have run out of memory (which was 128M), is it possible to clean it in some way so I can get space and be able to reindex again? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Var Folder:</strong>\nI have the permissions required - 755 - which lets the owner to write - but still no <em>locks</em>  folder. The var folder is in my root folder and not in the tmp folder.</p>\n\n<p>I have access to my backend, I am able to Flush all Magento cache. The only thing I am not able to do is reindex this Catalog product price. </p>\n\n<p>Yesterday I created some new attributes and products. Just after that I wasn't able to reindex. Any other suggestions please? Thanks in advance.</p>",

In the course of a day the average person can walk a certain distance, particularly when working. It is therefore not surprising that the feet become sore, especially when shoes and sick or synthetic fibers are used. In addition, the feet can also emit a foul odor, especially if you wear sneakers. One solution to alleviate the pain and smelly feet is to apply foot powder, which can be store bought or home. Store-bought foot powders can be expensive and may contain unknown chemicals to make your own powdered know exactly what ingredients are in it and spend less money.

I explain: All these players are on controlled environment, because this, you can sniff the information between NerveGear and the servers. But, you doesn't know the use of these data. When you do a sniff on a MMO, you are playing the mmo itself, because this, you view a packet going to the server or from the server and the effect of this packet on your screen. If you receive a bunch of packets, but you cannot relate it with the proper actions on the game, all these information are more or less shit. More, if these information are encrypted. If you have 5 packets, for example, you can try to relate itself with actions (for example doing one more time the same action for view common packets). But, if you have thousands of them, you doesn't have nothing.</p>",

So it is important you understand what supplements to take before you begin a workout and after a workout. Now that you have tips for building your muscles, it's critical that you start today. Put the tips into action and start laying the groundwork for stronger muscles. Don't wait. You may not see results instantly, but if you start today, you will indeed start to see the body that you want. What you eat is going to make a difference in the results that you get from muscle building. You must keep your calorie count up and increase the amount of protein that you consume, while reducing the levels of fat that are consumed.

However, above those limits, it can be subject to gift tax.  I think beyond $13,000 per year, you have to start keeping track of such gifts; gift tax does not actually kick in until a larger number, but it counts gifts spread across several years.</p></li>\n<li><p>The one major exception is if you give the money to a registered charitable organization.  Then you can deduct the gift from your income, again up to certain limits (usually 50% of your income).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: If you want tax advice, talk to a professional who's qualified to give it.

As i said i need 12 rows with 31 days straight from the top so i created my boxes using 3 big rectangles in the same place and splitting them into grids. At the moment i had 3 equal grids in one place. I left the bottom one as boxes which will contain days and produce the space where i will be able to write in the notes. I resized second grid almost all the way to the left (to be honest i resized every column individually from the right side to produce the space on the early left side of the box just to make a threaded text from it and using certain font size and copying a column from excel (just typed 1 in the top and two in a latter row and dragged the box down to 31) while i pressed type cursor at the first column of second grid in AI. It caused to fill 31 day numbers in the left on my boxes. Next i erased unnecessary days like 29, 30, 31 Feb and in latter months. Next i continued to paste the day numbers in next boxes. Coming to third  grid i resized first and latter columns to the right just to leave some space for weekday names. So i made some columns in Excel from Mon dragging down to 31 as for 31 days and continued to do so for every weekday starting month. Next i copied the one which starts from Thu because 1.01 this year starts with Thursday and copied it in right side column (third grid). After all that i've been left with every single day in a year with weekdays and a box to fill in with my notes on a dry wipe later. I changed the opacity to 80 something % and put a nice picture in the background with my company name and inserted month names on the top of columns and arranged them to a key object a box below just to have them aligned in the centre of the box.</p>\n\n<p>Hope it helps someone and thanks for responses!\nRegards</p>",

The attractive nature of the force is only strong enough to bind the two nucleons if they have aligned spins (as in the bound state of the deuteron which as a neutron and proton with aligned spins and total angular momentum 1). If the two nucleons were identical however, i.e. a p+p or n+n interaction, then a bound state state with aligned spins would be forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.</p>\n\n<p>The deeper reasons behind this spin dependence will need an answer from someone with a much better understanding of these issues.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>While not as elaborate as some of the others, \nHow about something on the order of the Havenites from David Weber's Honorverse.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically their Basic Living Stipend...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1700 PD, the Republic was renamed the \"People's Republic of Haven\" and used a kind of deceit that transformed the poor sections of society into a welfare state, in which citizens were entitled to a specified standard of living adjusted for inflation known as a Basic Living Stipend. The new head of state became the Hereditary President. A new breed of machine politicians, called Dolist Managers, emerged as kingmakers, being able to deliver the votes of millions of so-called \"Dolists\" to the candidates (called Legislaturists) of their choosing. Some years later, the deteriorating financial and economic condition of the Republic led to the DuQuesne Plan which expected to use conquest to make up the shortfall. The original Havenite democracy disappeared, and power came to be concentrated within the Legislaturalist families, who established a number of secret police organizations to maintain control over the renamed People's Republic of Haven. The original Havenite Constitution was replaced by a new document which enshrined >Legislaturalist rule. This constitution was the first step of the so-called \"DuQuesne Plan\", named after the Havenite politician who proposed it. (HH1)</p>\n  \n  <p>In 1804 PD, the treasury was effectively empty . (HH4) \n  Source:<a href=\"http://honorverse.wikia.com/wiki/Republic_of_Haven\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://honorverse.wikia.com/wiki/Republic_of_Haven</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, this also translated into schooling -- only, certain pre-approved texts being taught, with limited support for innovations.\nAdditionally, add in the fact that it devolved into something like the French Revolution.</p>\n\n<p>To translate Fiction into psudo-fact,some industrialized country with a large welfare state embarks on a plan similar to the Basic Living Stipend -- granting recipients a guaranteed income.  Even though some politicians see the handwriting on the wall, this movement gets entrenched to the point that \"The sky is falling\" realists get voted out -- and, everybody if they realize it, tends to push it onto the next generation (e.g. it's not going to happen to us...its a future problem).  </p>\n\n<p>As this is occurring, there's no incentive to work or study -- why, we're getting our Basic Living Stipend...we don't need to expend extra effort in those areas.</p>\n\n<p>Now, some brilliant mind, figures on the \"DuQuesne Plan\" -- invade/raid nearby solvent countries and run roughshod over their finances and use that to prop up our pyramid scheme of a government. </p>\n\n<p>Now, if said government had access to modern weapons and a willingness to use them, this might pose an issue with 'removing' them.  Plus, modern warfare could create economic, sociological, and economic catastrophes.</p>\n\n<p>True, this might not cause immediate anarchy, but at least it is a 'possibility'...</p>",

		"Title" : "Best movie of all time, especially the last hour and fifteen of Vol. 2. ...",
		"Body" : "<p>Best movie of all time, especially the last hour and fifteen of Vol. 2. It's not just one genre of movie like all movies are, like a thriller, a scary flick, a country western or Kung Fu, it's one story but somehow Tarantino tells a story of revenge mostly but he incorporates every single movie genre just about ever made. At least when talking about HollyWood, I can't say it's like some of the movies in the East but as far as all the genres we've seen and our parents have seen come out of Hollywood, Tarantino seamlessly intertwined all those genres together into one movie, one story. Just in the last hour and fifteen or so of Vol. 2 he is even able to do it so not just over the entire film One and Two but even in the last hour with the climax building he's able to still even seemlessly blend all those genres in the most serious last hour of the movie and even get some light comedy in there. When Beatrice Kiddo is hit with the truth dart and Bill is asking her questions and she tells about the last trip she was sent on and found out she was pregnant and the assasin comes to her room, once she leaves she looks through the blast hole through the door and says congratulations in this odd awkward way that doesn't take you away from the serious of the climax building but is still a slight hand of comedy. They just don't make movies like this. Hell all I see when I turn HBO on is \"Pacific Rim\" or \"Battle Ship\" or just some total shit with absolutely no thought other than one single idea, then a big budget and it's like they start filming without a final script and just this idea and they let half ass actors either read the half ass script or improve and its littlerally unwatchable. Now I did love \"Fury\" which came out not too long ago but I used to go to the movies, not all the time but at least more than once or twice a year. Now with the prices so high and the quality of movies it takes a \"No Country for Old Men\" or a \"Fury\" to even get me to think of paying $12 bucks for a movie at the Theatre and how many years had gone by since \"No Country for Old Men\" and \"Fury\" came out. More than just one bad season of movies, we're talking '07 to '14. Seven years between two movies I can honestly say I'm gonna pay $12 bucks and go see that. Now I'm sure I'm leaving some other good movies out, not everything from '08-'13 has been Pacific Rim and Battle ship bad but that's my point I can honestly only think of those two movies that were absolutely worth going and seeing time and time again. Now I went to \"Wolverine\" when it came out b/c just like the Batman series that came out from DC comics had finally taken the complete Cheezyness out of the superhero movies and for Batman I loved how it showed what he went through to become so strong willed and learned his fighting technique. I don't ask for much, but if someone can fly or shoot bullets out there ass just give me a small portion of the story that shows how bullets are flying out of someone's ass you know? Like Batman's I grew up watching you knew he was mental b/c he saw his parents die in front of him at a young age but other than that how did this rich spoiled kid learn to fight and have the stuff to fight with. The latest Batman series finally showed that and the latest Wolverine even though it wasn't the beganing of the Wolverine at least it had a back story with him during WW2 and since im a history buff or at least studied history in college so a self proclaimed history buff and I read a lot about history having wolverine caged with the Japan Empire and watching the Bomb drop then showed him living in the woods and never wants to fight again all made it more real b/c he's lived it and has seen that there's no winners in a war and that it hurts people. None of my friends even got that connection they were so tied up with the evil old japanese tycoon who wants to live forever that they totally missed the most vital part of the latest Wolverine which in no way am I comparing Kill Bill or No Country for Old Men, even Fury with the latest Batman series or the latest Wolverine im just saying you can still have a big budget movie that the producers are only in it for the money and not the art and still have some things everyone can relate too or either tell the story and the whole story why the person is or thinks the way they do during the film. Wolverine is tired of all the killing he's seen living for 200year or whatever and Batman can kick ass b/c he disappeared and lived as a criminal and then learned the way of fighting with the league of shadows and then once he's at his graduation with the league and supposed to kill a criminal all of a sudden his upbringing and the character instilled in him as a boy hits him and he then decides he doesn't wanna just kill criminals which is what he tried to do to his parents murderer once he was let out of jail so he saw all criminals as the one that killed his parents, he at that moment becomes batman and then comes home and has the coperation that has its hands in many things including a science and military applications department where he gets all that cool stuff. It amazes me that I mean how hard could it had been to write and direct another batman series but yet they finally got it right this time even for a movie that isn't or shouldn't win any movie of the year awards but yet is just a fun movie to see and we still have all this crap that comes out in Hollywood and somehow they just market the shit out of it and it makes hundreds of millions of dollars, now I don't know what Pacific Rim made, I pray Americans are smarter than to allow a movie like that make hundreds of millions but then again it wouldn't surprise me. It's not Hollywoods fault crap comes pouring out of there every year, it's our fault for allowing it to happen. You don't have to go see a movie just b/c Someone is in it right away, if it's sketchy looking then let it come to HBO and watch it for free at home a month later b/c if none of us show up then it'll be on DVD and Blueray in a month and at a Redbox for a dollar then for free a month later on TV. We have to make Hollywood go back and start treating us like we're all not stupid robots. The sad thing is the day Kill Bill came out even though I couldn't wait long enough to see it in the evening so I went to an early showing but the theatre was empty and it didn't do great at the box office numbers but yet it's now a classic. How a movie like that wasn't marketed as much as a Pacific Rim before it's release date just doesn't make sense. </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>There's a very simple answer. Management traffic such as SSH, HTTP, ICMP is handled by the CPU. The main purpose of the switch is traffic forwarding, and management traffic has the lowest priority. Thus when CPU is roofing, all mgmt access gets trampled underway to preserve the network services. </p>\n\n<p>If you're running and old code you might be bumping into a SW issue. Download current SW from HPN website and upgrade. If you don't need the latest and greatest features but rather are interested in stability, go for the Maintenance release, current one is K.15.10.0015m. It has longer lifespan than the others, and new features aren't added so it will update only if there's a bugfix. </p>\n\n<p>PVID mismatch is also a simple one. The PVID of Procurve is the VLAN id of the untagged VLAN. PVID mismatch shouldn't affect the CPU, but it will fill up your log with unnecessary crap. Mismatching the VLAN tagging also causes broadcasts from one subnet to spill into another which isn't a behavior you want to see. So ensure VLAN tagging matches on both ends of the link.</p>",

		"Title" : "Serbian has something like that, if I am understanding you right. Some S...",
		"Body" : "<p><strong>Serbian</strong> has something like that, if I am understanding you right. Some Serbian intransitive sentences can still have dative and/or locative arguments; an example for this would be <code>\u043E\u043D\u0430 \u043C\u0443[D] \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430 (\u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438)[L]</code> (<em>she is telling him about the house</em>) where there's both a dative listener <code>\u043C\u0443</code> (to him) and a locative topic <code>\u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438</code> (about the house).</p>\n\n<p>We are certain that neither of these is a direct object because 1) neither is in either the genitive or the accusative (Serbian DOs must be in either one of those cases) and 2) neither can be made into the subject of a passive verb form: sentences such as <code>*\u043E\u043D \u0458\u0435 \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043D \u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438</code> (<em>he is told about the house</em>) and <code>*\u043A\u0443\u045B\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u045A\u0435\u043C\u0443</code> (<em>the house is told to him</em>) do not work and sound quite ungrammatical. The only passive sentences these two arguments could fit in would be in the spirit of <code>\u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043D\u043E \u043C\u0443[D] \u0458\u0435 (\u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438)[L]</code> (<em>it was talked to him about the house</em>) and those kinds of sentences still retain both the locative and dative arguments.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is possible to add an accusative into the example sentence, thus for example giving: <code>\u043E\u043D\u0430 \u043C\u0443[D] \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0443[A] (\u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438)[L]</code>. Such a sentence can easily be turned into a passive one, giving f.e. <code>\u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\u043D\u0430 \u043C\u0443[D] \u0458\u0435 \u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430[N] (\u043E \u043A\u0443\u045B\u0438)[L]</code> where the former accusative argument \"\u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0443\" becomes a nominative argument \"\u043F\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0430\" in accordance with general passivisation patterns in nominative languages.</p>\n\n<p>The only way these sentences could be analysed as including a direct object would be to analyse them as having a dropped or implied accusative argument, which is otherwise unheard of in Serbian.</p>\n\n<p>This also has a parallel in sentences with a non-nominative subject; a sentence with a genitive, accusative or dative subject is usually intransitive, but can also have additional arguments that do not serve as direct objects.</p>\n\n<p>With a genitive subject, these are most often sentences in the mould of <code>\u043D\u0435\u043C\u0430 \u043D\u0430\u043C[D] \u043F\u043E\u0441\u043B\u0430[G]</code> (<em>there's no job for us</em>) or have an experiencer (such as <code>\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435[G] \u043C\u0435[G] \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043C\u043E\u0442\u0430</code> <em>it's you who I'm ashamed of</em>; this sentence has two genitive arguments). With a dative subject, they are usually those with experiencers, such as <code>\u0445\u043B\u0430\u0434\u043D\u043E \u043C\u0443[D] \u0458\u0435</code> (<em>he feels cold</em>, more directly <em>it's cold to him</em>). With an accusative subject, they also usually are with experiencers, such as <code>\u0436\u0430\u043E \u043C\u0438[A] \u0442\u0435[G] \u0458\u0435</code> (<em>I feel sorry for you</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Such sentences with non-nominative subjects and additional arguments but without a DO still cannot be passivised. They'd give sentences like <code>*\u043F\u043E\u0441\u0430\u043E \u043D\u0430\u043C \u043D\u0435\u043C\u0430</code>, <code>*\u0441\u0440\u0430\u043C\u043E\u0442\u0430\u043D \u0441\u0430\u043C \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435</code> and <code>*\u0436\u0430\u043E \u0441\u0430\u043C \u0442\u0435</code>; these sound utterly wrong and ungrammatical. The closest equivalents would have to use different verbs or phrasings for that, giving <code>\u043D\u0435\u043C\u0430\u043C\u043E \u043F\u043E\u0441\u043B\u0430</code> (<em>we don't have a job</em>), <code>\u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u043C\u043E\u0442\u0438\u043C</code> (<em>it's you who I'm ashamed of</em>), and <code>\u0436\u0430\u043B\u0438\u043C \u0442\u0435</code> (<em>I pity you</em>), which are all sentences with DOs and a dropped pronominal subject.</p>",

How can one computer <em>possibly</em> know the state of another computer without connecting to it? Computers are not psychic.</p>\n\n<p>No, the computer must connect to the other computer in order to get information from it, such as the current time.</p>\n\n<p>So you're going to have to write a java program that connects to the other computer on the LAN.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if your question is can you avoid writing a second program, maybe. You can try to get access to the shell of the machine you're connecting to from your java program, but you're going to have to implement SSH in your java program, which isn't going to be easy. You could find an SSH library perhaps, although Windows 7 doesn't support SSH anyways.</p>\n\n<p>Easiest by far would be to simply write two programs, or write a single program that can act as sever or client. Then run it on both computers, have one computer connect to the other, and then they can communicate back and forth about what time each computer's OS has. Since you're writing the program yourself you can make the rules about the protocol and determine which port it will listen on, and you can guarantee that the program will be running and listening on that port.</p>",

But in this kind of situation, I don't think anyone cares too much if the amount of money isn't too much, and counting in when you get the money should be fine. It's only of any importance to decide in which year you pay the tax - say you send a bill on March 30th and get the money end of April, you'd have to pay tax in the previous tax year. </p>\n\n<p>I doubt that vouchers would count as cash, until you exchange them for cash. </p>\n\n<p>Worst case, if you call the tax office and ask them \"I made \u00A32,000, how can I pay tax for it\" instead of just putting the money in your pocket, they will be happy to get your money and be just helpful and forgive all your sins. </p>\n\n<p>You should have a look at www.hmrc.gov.uk for all details; it's quite easy to understand. Keep all the papers related to your income and especially any papers related to expenses that you want to deduct in a safe place. And then you just have a few additional forms in your annual self assessment. </p>",

What about using those classes from <a href=\"http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/math/Vector3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">libgdx</a>? Libgdx uses LWJGL for desktop rendering as well and has a lot of tools integrated that makes programming easier. It also allows to easy build portable apps for different plattforms, e.g. Android. In my games I always seperate game logic from graphics.</p>\n\n<p>With libgdx the last addition is simply that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.position.add(wayTowardPlayer);\n</code></pre>",

No matter what I did - enter+shift in the visual or insert the tags manually in the html editor - I tried several things but nothing worked. Interesting fact: on the page I am working have already been a few br's which are working without any problems, so I looked through the code if there was something but I still couldn't find anything.</p>\n\n<p>I found an <strong>acceptable solution</strong> for this: Simple Breaks. This plugin gives me the possibility to insert br tags by writing the shortcode \"[br]\". I'm kinda fine with that.</p>\n\n<p>Still I truely want to ask you if you have similiar problems or if there is any solution to this! It is known that WP has it's problems with br's and p's so I guess the users just have to go with it.</p>\n\n<p>Greetings from germany and pls don't be too hard on my bad english :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>More information:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I already unchecked \"WordPress should correct invalidly nested XHTML automatically\" in Admin > Settings > Writing.

		"Body" : "<p>Thank you for the great suggestion @RoryDaulton !  Below is the project description that i decided upon for this project.  The students can pick from one of the below options for their project, or have the opportunity to come up with their own idea.  Figured I would post this for anyone who would like to get ideas for similar project ideas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family Tree</strong>\nA Square provides very detailed descriptions of the social ladder in Flatland and how Flatlanders proceed are able to slowly climb from generation to generation (Ch. 3, Ch. 7, Ch. 11).  For this project, you will construct a family tree, starting from an isosceles triangle all the way to a circle.  Here are the requirements for this project:\nInclude at least 7 family members from distinct generations, including the very first isosceles triangle and the final circle</p>\n\n<p>-For each family member provide a picture, basic measurements, and a paragraph of biographical information, making sure to include what generation they are in and who their parents and children are.  Be as creative as you would like!</p>\n\n<p>-Provide your \u201Crules\u201D for your family tree.  A Square, while thorough, does not provide us with actual numbers, likely because every family is slightly different.  For your family, I would like to know the starting angles on the original isosceles triangle, how much that angle increases from generation to generation, at what generation it is considered an equilateral triangle, how the side numbers increase from generation to generation, how many sides constitute a circle, and how many total generations it took to make it to a circle (This list is not exhaustive. Make sure to provide ALL information that is needed to understand your family tree)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Worldbuilder</strong>\nIn Chapter 11, \u201CConcerning Our Priests\u201D, A Square begins the chapter by apologizing to the readers that he will not be able to explain the entirety of Flatland, including such topics as \u201Cour method of propelling and stopping ourselves,...the means in which we give fixity to structures of wood, stone, or brick...our Alphabet and method of writing, \u201D  Your job for this project is to pick three aspects of Flatland that A Square does not provide an explanation for and come up with (they do not have to be the ones that he says in Ch. 11) a description of how you think they would work for Flatlanders.</p>\n\n<p>-Provide a brief background to each topic and why Flatlanders cannot perform the task or experience the phenomenon in the same way that we Spacelanders can</p>\n\n<p>-For each topic give a complete description as to how the topic is handled in Flatland.  Each topic must be at least a page in length, with a title and date</p>\n\n<p>-You can be as creative as you would like, providing your description is consistent with A Square\u2019s own description (You can\u2019t say \u201CThe Flatlanders just pick it up with their hands\u201D because polygons do not have hands, at least as we know them.  If you would like to give your Flatlanders hands then you need to describe exactly what you mean by \u201Chands\u201D and how it fits into Abbott\u2019s Flatland)</p>\n\n<p>-Creatively frame your topics by introducing yourself as a citizen of Flatland and your motivation for writing the three passages, just like Abbott did with A Square</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phlatland: A Derivative Work</strong>\nFor this project, you will use Flatland as an inspiration for your own creative work.  Your project does not necessarily need to be a piece of fiction, it can be a movie, a song, an epic poem or any creative mode of expressing a mathematical story.  It does not necessarily need to be structured the way Flatland is, however, if you decide to tell your story in a different world or universe you need to provide some level of explanation so that the reader/listener/watcher knows what is going on.  </p>\n\n<p>-A creative work of sufficient length that ties together storytelling and mathematics</p>\n\n<p>-You may produce a recreation of Flatland in a different media than written fiction (comic, short film, song) provided it is consistent with the universe and story of Flatland</p>\n\n<p>-It must somehow reference Flatland or an aspect of Flatland as laid out by A Square</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other Ideas</strong></p>\n\n<p>-A Map of Flatland:  Create a map of an entire Flatland city including exact measurements and a brief history of the city and its context within Flatland</p>\n\n<p>-Flatlander Profiles:  Detail the lives of a handful of various Flatlanders, including detailed biographical information, sketches, and different possible cross sections</p>\n\n<p>-Flatland Infographic:  Create an \u201CEverything Flatland\u201D infographic that explains all of the details of the Flatland Universe and A Square\u2019s journey</p>",

		"Body" : "<h1>What is the Purpose of Own Antyesthi (Cremation) before taking Sanyasa?</h1>\n\n<p>It is because the rites are performed when the body dies. Similarly when one takes up Sannyasa, it is symbolic that His body attachment is now dead. That is one has cut off all ties with His physical body. Therefore the cremation rites are performed.</p>\n\n<p>Paramahansa Yogananda describes this in Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The bibidisa or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a fire ceremony, during which symbolical funeral rites are performed. The physical body of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the flame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then given a chant, such as: \"This atma is Brahma\" or \"Thou art That\" or \"I am He.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However this is not necessary for all initiation. For example, Paramahansa Yogananda did not do this ceremony, because Sri Yukteshwarji (His Guru) did not feel it was needed at all, doing away with all rituals.</p>\n\n<p>Paramahansa Yogananda describes this in Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sri Yukteswar, however, with his love of simplicity, dispensed with all formal rites and merely asked me to select a new name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that also would answer your other question:</p>\n\n<h1>On which Basis(Spiritual Qualities) does Guru gives a new name to Sanyasi or Shishya(Disciple)?</h1>\n\n<p>There is no rule for this. The Guru simply follows His Intuition or inner Guidance or Dharma. Whatever you call it. For example, Paramhansa Yogananda was asked to choose His own spiritual Title:</p>\n\n<p>Paramahansa Yogananda describes this in Autobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I will give you the privilege of choosing it yourself,\" he said, smiling.\n  \"Yogananda,\" I replied, after a moment's thought. The name literally means \"Bliss (ananda) through divine union (yoga).\"\n  \"Be it so. Forsaking your family name of Mukunda Lal Ghosh, henceforth you shall be called Yogananda of the Giri branch of the Swami Order.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Is there any Co-relation of above two:</h1>\n\n<p>The only correlation is that only the One who has give up all ties to body and physical differences can take up the name of Swami. Thus the two are actually correlated in the sense one is a pre-requisite for the other.</p>\n\n<p>Paramhansa Yogananda describes the qualities of Sannyasis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The ideal of selfless service to all mankind, and of renunciation of personal ties and ambitions, leads the majority of swamis to engage actively in humanitarian and educational work in India, or occasionally in foreign lands.</p>\n  \n  <p>Imbuing his waking and sleeping consciousness with the thought, \"I am He,\" he roams contentedly, in the world but not of it. Thus only may he justify his title of swami one who seeks to achieve union with the Swa or Self.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is needless to add that not all formally titled swamis are equally successful in reaching their high goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>How about Swami Vivekananda?</h1>\n\n<p>Swami Vivekananda, after Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa's Mahasamadhi, took up Sannyaas with eight other disciples, and thus took the title of Sri Swami Vivekananda which means the Bliss of Viveka (or Discrimination).[ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhuyan200310-63\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reference</a>: Wikipedia (Not sure how accurate this is though)]</p>\n\n<p>Thus in summary, these names are not necessarily given by Guru, also these titles are given as per intuition or spiritual guidance, not many prescribed rules exist for naming.</p>",

I would look to see if you can trim down on your nav items before removing the home button if you must.  </p>\n\n<p>Other considerations I have when including or not including the home button is to ask the following questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is there a need for the user to go back to the homepage often during a session? \nSometimes the home page is just an intro to the site and rarely does the user go back in one session. This means even if they don't figure out that the logo brings them back to home, they can probably use the back button or some other means to figure out how to get back there. </p></li>\n<li><p>Is it expected that the user will land on your home page?\nIf this is an existing site you can check analytics.  Otherwise it'll be a bit of a guess.  Not all sites have their home page as a \"front door\".  Blogs for example will get a lot of entries from an article page.  The ability to navigate back to the home page in that case is very important.  </p></li>\n</ol>",

But inspired by your excellent meta question, there was then a rather inofficial <a href=\"http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/q/1441/49\">Biweekly Topic Challenge for <em>Interstellar</em></a> proposed by a single user as a kind of proof of concept and it did very well with 31 asked questions (though, it's unclear if that was due to the challenge or just a natural consequence of a new release).</p>\n\n<p>After that we started an official <a href=\"http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/q/1464/49\">Topic Challenge asking for ideas</a> whithout much imposition on the particular start day or the length of the challenge. We already did some of the proposed topics, more or less tied to current releases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/q/1470/49\">Topic Challenge: The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings</a> [Completed]</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/q/1514/49\">Topic Challenge: Michael Mann and his films</a> [Completed]</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://meta.movies.stackexchange.com/q/1520/49\">Topic Challenge: Johnny Depp and his films</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They don't go too well, though. While questions per day is ~10, meta activity and site commitment aren't particularly high at the moment and we're also slightly season-dependent with currently being a bit of a meh-period in the cinemas. That being said we'll not give up on topic challenges and I have a bit more hopes for the planned Oscar-accompanying challenges following. Afterall thank you very much for this inspiring meta discussion.</p>",

Then, when you no longer need your temporary tower, you quickly replace the bottom block with a torch (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oF9G2WlVcrE\" rel=\"nofollow\">or use something like this</a>), and the entire sand tower is removed without you needing to waste time and tool durability mining/digging away the temporary tower.</p>",

Very simple and worked perfectly with just a couple seconds of failover time. </p>\n\n<p>Edits:</p>\n\n<p>I had two new virtualized SQL Servers. The databases were coming from 3 servers that they had just plain outgrown, and were impacting performance on the smaller databases hosted on them.</p>\n\n<p>The process was very simple. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Wait for weekend full backups to complete</li>\n<li>Restore with no recovery to new servers</li>\n<li>When those restores complete, pause backups</li>\n<li>Run one additional restore up to the latest log backup from originals</li>\n<li>Start mirroring across all six</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I chose to leave them in asynchronous mode until we were ready to fail them over to reduce load on the network, etc. Mirroring has some reputation for causing latency during maintenance (index/statistics) and other high volume activities, but I didn't find that to be true.</p>\n\n<p>During the next maintenance window, I manually failed over each database, and after some smoke testing, turned mirroring off, and eventually removed the old data files from the originating servers. One quirk in this process is that failing a mirrored database over leaves the former primary in a recovering state, so unless you're comfortable just dropping them, you need to bring them back online and then detach, or whatever your preferred method of removal is.</p>\n\n<p>Please let me know if you'd like any further specifics. I've left out server and network specs but can provide if you'd like. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>",

Hence, the singular locus has codimension at most 2 in $X$. We can consider everything outside the singular locus because we work on the level of divisors of $X$. Hence $P$ is just smooth and $X$ is Cartier and everything is true for you.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:\n@LiYutong, of course I did not mean that $K_P$ is Cartier (which is not true in general). I mean that there exists a codimension 3 subset $Z$ of $P$ such that $U=P-Z$ is smooth and hence $X|_U$ is Cartier divisor on $U$. Hence $K_{X|_U}=(K_U+X|_U)|_{X|_U}$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$-trivial by adjunction. Not that $X-X|_U$ has codimension 2 in $X$, so the Weil divisors class $\\rm{Cl}(X)$ on $X$ coincides with  the Weil divisors class $\\rm{Cl}(X|_U)$ on $X|_U$ by restriction.\n So $K_X\\sim_\\mathbb{Q}0$.</p>",

However, when \"cut off from [other places in specific contexts]\" occurs, it may mean other things: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2Ch 26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for <strong>he was cut off from the house of the LORD:</strong> and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</p>\n  \n  <p>Uzziah was not killed at that time, but became a leper and was no longer allowed to the temple, or even within Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Summa summarum</strong>: Generally, \"cut off\", when it is a generic punishment or statement, means death/extinction.  However, in certain specific circumstances the phrase refers to separation from a particular location or institution.</p>",

If you don't understand the situation then it becomes much harder to come to terms with. If they do divorce you'll have questions preying on your mind for a very long time. If they don't divorce, without knowing why you'll find yourself always worrying whenever there's a tiny argument. This is why it's important that you know.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody here can tell you why your parents are considering divorce, only your parents know and only they can explain it to you. This is why my advice to you is to confront them about it - ask them outright, be it alone or together, why they want to divorce. The truth may hurt, but not knowing will hurt more.</p>\n\n<p>If you understand why they are considering divorce you can form an opinion on whether it's a good thing or a bad thing and then express your opinion to your parents. Parents always value their kid's opinions, and even if they don't agree with you they'll acknowledge your opinion, which is another important thing.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, whatever happens, make sure that your parents know that you love them both and that whatever they choose to do you'll support them both, even if you don't agree with their decision. It might be hard, but it's better for everyone to part on good terms, even if you change your mind later in life.</p>",

Good luck.</p>\n\n<p><strong>John Grisham: The Partner</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of great writing that definitely came from an author who thought about all these things.  No matter what you think of Grisham and his novels I believe if you read one sentence you will want to read more so it is a great example of this stimulus / response and using the exact right language.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They found him in Ponta Pora, a pleasant little town in Brazil, on the\n  border of Paraguay, in a land still known as the Frontier.</p>\n  \n  <p>They found him living in a shaded brick house on Rua Tiradentes, a\n  wide avenue with trees down the center and barefoot boys dribbling\n  soccer balls along the hot pavement.</p>\n  \n  <p>They found him alone, as best they could tell, though a maid came and\n  went at odd hours during the eight days they hid and watched.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can read more of the excerpt at :\n<a href=\"http://newtonsaber.com/AmazonBooks/BookLink.aspx?author=grisham\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Grisham - The Partner (amazon link)</a></p>",

		"Body" : "<p>By popular demand (considering two to be popular \u2014 thanks @Rod Vance and @Love Learning), I'll expand a bit on my comment to @Kieran Hunt's answer:</p>\n\n<h3>Thermal equilibrium</h3>\n\n<p>As I said in the comment, the notion of sound in space plays a very significant role in cosmology: When the Universe was very young, dark matter, normal (\"baryonic\") matter, and light (photons) was in thermal equilibrium, i.e. they shared the same (average) energy per particle, or temperature. This temperature was so high, that neutral atoms couldn't form; everytime it tried, the electron would get knocked off by a photon (or another particle). The photons themselves couldn't travel very far, before hitting a free electron.</p>\n\n<h3>Speed of sound in the primordial soup</h3>\n\n<p>Everything was very smooth, no galaxies or anything like that had formed. Stuff was still slightly clumpy, though, and the clumps growed in size due to gravity. But as a clump grows, pressure from baryons and photons increase, counteracting the collapse, and pushing baryons and photons outwards, while the dark matter tends to stay at the center of the overdensity, since it doesn't care about pressure. This creates oscillations, or sound waves with tremendously long wavelengths, and with velocities of the order of half the speed of light (here you cannot use the formula given by @Kieran Hunt, since the pressure of photon cannot be neglected, instead you use the more general\n$$c = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\frac{p}{\\rho}},$$\nwhere $p$ and $\\rho$ are the pressure and density of the gas; this formula reduces to @Kieran Hunt's for an ideal gas).</p>\n\n<h3>Recombination</h3>\n\n<p>As the Universe expanded, it gradually cooled down. At an age of 379,000 years it had reached a temperature of ~3000 K, and protons and electron could now combine to form neutral atoms. This is called the \"Epoch of Recombination\", though they hadn't previously been combined.</p>\n\n<h3>Decoupling</h3>\n\n<p>Suddenly (the cosmological \"suddenly\" \u2014 I think it was over a course of ~10,000 years) the free electrons disappeared, and photons could stream freely, diffusing away and relieving the overdensity of its pressure.</p>\n\n<h3>Cosmic microwave background</h3>\n\n<p>The radiation that decoupled has ever since redshifted due to the expansion of the Universe, and since the Universe has now expanded ~1100 times, we see the light (called the cosmic microwave background, or CMB) now with a temperature of 3000 K (which was the temperature of the Universe at the time of decoupling), but a temperature of (3000 K)/1100 = 2.73 K, which is the temperature that @Kieran Hunt refers to in his answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Baryon acoustic oscillations</h3>\n\n<p>These overdensities, or <i>baryon acoustic oscillations</i> (BAOs),  are on much larger scales than galaxies, but galaxies tend to clump on these scales, which has ever since expanded and now has a characteristic scale of ~100 $h^{-1}$Mpc, or 465 million lightyears. Measuring how the inter-clump distance change with time provides a way of understanding the expansion history, and acceleration, of the Universe, independent of other methods such as supernovae and the CMB. And beautifully, <a href=\"http://francis.naukas.com/files/2010/02/dibujo20100220_cosmological_precision_data_from_wmap_5_bao_sne.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">the methods all agree</a>.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At last i found a solution my self, </p>\n\n<p>By default CSS is treated as a render blocking resource, which means that the browser will hold rendering of any processed content until the CSSOM is constructed. Make sure to keep your CSS lean, deliver it as quickly as possible, and use media types and queries to unblock rendering.</p>\n\n<p>To fix this issue, what you need to do is identify the style sheet rule that applies to the above fold content, just remove them from the external css file, minify them and deliver it as inline CSS. And then move your external css link to bottom of the page. Like below, </p>\n\n<pre><code><html>\n  <head>\n    <style>\n      .blue{color:blue;}\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"blue\">\n      Hello, world!\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After making the style rule delivery of above fold as like this, i could achieve speed score 100/100 for one of my landing page. You can have a look on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnavasazeez.com%2Fseo-tools%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\">speed insight score</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE: Never use inline css delivery if style rule is to heavy</strong></p>",

		"Body" : "<h1>CJam, 34 bytes</h1>\n\n<pre><code>1l+256b2b1>l{'a-\"11W:mm%!<>\">4%~}/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It uses the following characters for instructions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a: left rotation\nb: right rotation\nc: reverse\nd: flip\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The input is taking from STDIN with the word on the first line and the instruction string on the second line.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://cjam.aditsu.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Test it here.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n\n<p>Getting the bit string is really just a matter of interpreting the character codes as the digits of a base-256 number (and getting its base-2 representation). The tricky thing is that the latter base conversion won't pad the result with 0s on the left. Therefore, I add a leading 1 to the initial input, and then split off that 1 again in the binary representation. As an example, if the input is <code>ab</code>, I turn that into an array <code>[1 'a 'b]</code>, interpret that as base-256 (characters are automatically converted to character codes), which is <code>90466</code> and the to base-2, which is <code>[1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0]</code>. Now if I just remove that leading <code>1</code> I've got the bitstream I'm looking for.</p>\n\n<p>That's what this part of the code does:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1l+256b2b1>\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I read the list of instructions and execute a block for each character in the instruction string:</p>\n\n<pre><code>l{...}/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to subtract the character <code>a</code> from each instruction, which turns them into integers <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> or <code>3</code>. Now the real golfy magic... depending on the instruction I want to run a short piece of code that implements the operation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Character -> Integer:  Code  Operation\na            0         1m<   \"Left rotation\";\nb            1         1m>   \"Right rotation\";\nc            2         W%    \"Reverse\";\nd            3         :!    \"Flip each bit\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I could store these in an array of blocks and choose the right block to run, but encoding them in a string is actually shorter:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"11W:mm%!<>\">4%~\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First, I use the integer associate with the instruction to slice off the beginning of the string. So for left rotation, the string is unchanged, for right rotation the first character is discarded and so on. Then I select every fourth character from the string, starting from the first, with <code>4%</code>. Notice how the four code snippets are distributed throughout the string. Finally I just evaluate the string as code with <code>~</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The bit string is printed automatically at the end of the program.</p>",

Often used to induce fear. Someone with a skull tattoo scary, right? This may have been the case before skulls appeared in pink pajamas. The second reason skulls are so popular is because they represent death, and the human race is obsessed with her. Skulls represent the physical part of death, decomposition of the body. Today, skulls are everywhere. Wear hats and ribbons. Dancing Skeletons, talk, drink and give riddles. Toddlers use coveralls with skulls suck pacifier.

When there's lots of snow on the ground (or for your case, maybe the local ground (probably a few <em>miles</em> in every direction) is something like a polished quartz?) and trees, and especially when there are low clouds, any light reflects around a lot and you can see pretty well.  It's nowhere near as bright as daylight, of course, and the light doesn't <em>seem</em> as bright as on a night with a full moon, but the light gets distributed more evenly than on a full moon so the shadows aren't as dark and you can see everywhere, more or less.</p>\n\n<p>There's definitely an impact during the day, since snow also reflects the sunlight.  But that's not really unexpected in climates that get lots of snow (I often wear sunglasses when driving in the summer (when the sun is high and bright) <em>and</em> in the winter (when it reflects off the snow) but not in fall or spring).</p>",

Should it be properly managed in Android regarding rights management - from my quite recent understanding (latest CM11 as of Jan 2015), Android does not expect the true external storage to understarnd, let alone enfore access rights. Since *FAT has no concept of any rights, this is no problem. However, in Linux there is no clean way of disabling rights management on a native filesystem. Android's concept of security uses UNIX access rights in a different way than it was intended. Not to blame Android, the UNIX concept is ancient but it's use comes at a price. The price being the need of external rights management which Android is not ready for and the User has (usually) no control of either.</p>\n\n<p>There is a way to use ext4 on Android, called Mounts2SD. It's quite clean and reliable though it is anything but native (made of \"nasty hacks\" some would say). I wouldn't recommend it unless you have absolute confidence in what you are doing.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/a/80334/2138\">A good answer has already been given by sasha</a>, but I want to look at this from another angle; specifically, what memcpy actually <em>does</em> (in terms of what code gets executed).</p>\n\n<p>Allowing for the possibility of minor bugs in this quick-and-dirty implementation, a trivial implementation of a function with the signature <code>void memcpy(void* target, void* source, size_t n)</code> (that's your regular memcpy()) might be something not entirely unlike:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for(size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)\n{\n     *target++ = *source++;\n     /* or possibly the here equivalent: target[i] = source[i]; */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The important part to note is that <strong>there is no bounds checking. <em>This is by design!</em></strong> There are three important things to keep in mind for why this is so:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>C is often used as a operating system programming language, and it was designed as a \"portable assembler\". Thus, the general approach to many of the old library functions, and the language in general, is that if you can do it in assembler, it should also be doable in C.</li>\n<li>There is no way to, given a pointer to a memory location, know how much memory is properly allocated at that location.</li>\n<li>Basically, arrays degenerate to pointers, where the unindexed array variable is the same thing as a pointer to the start of the array. This is not <em>strictly</em> true in every case, but it's good enough for us right now.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It follows from (1) that you should be able to copy any memory you want to, from anywhere to anywhere. Memory protection is <em>Someone Else's Problem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It follows from (2) that <code>memcpy()</code> and friends need to be told exactly how much data to copy, and they have to trust that the buffer at the target is sufficiently large to hold that data. Memory allocation is <em>The Programmer's Problem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It follows from (3) that we can't tell how much data is safe to copy. Making sure memory allocations are <em>sufficient</em> is <em>The Programmer's Problem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>When an attacker can control the number of bytes to copy using memcpy(), (2) and (3) break down. If the target buffer is too small, whatever follows it will be overwritten. If you are lucky, that will result in a memory access violation, but <em>C the language</em> or its standard libraries doesn't guarantee that it will happen. (You asked it to copy memory contents, and it either does that, or it dies trying.) If you pass a source array that is smaller than the number of bytes you ask for memcpy() to copy, there is reliable no way for memcpy() to tell that such is the case, and it will happily barrage on past the end of the source array as long as writing to the target location works.</p>\n\n<p>By allowing an attacker to control <code>n</code> in your example code, in such a way that <code>n</code> is larger than the maximum size of the array on the source side of the copy, memcpy() will because of the above points happily keep copying beyond the length of the intended source array.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That is why the code leaks data.</strong> <em>Exactly what data</em> is leaked depends both on the value of <code>n</code> and how the compiler lays out the machine language code in memory. The diagram in sasha's answer gives a good overview, and every architecture is similar but different.</p>\n\n<p>Depending on how exactly <code>buf</code> is declared, allocated and laid out, you might <strong>also</strong> have what is known as a <strong>stack smashing attack</strong> where data needed for the proper operation of the program is overwritten, and the data that overwrote whatever was there is subsequently referred to. In mundane cases this leads to crashes or nigh-impossible-to-debug bugs; in severe, targetted cases, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>",

The interview was over and no common ground had been found.  As they were parting ways, my mentor offered the card he had been holding until just that moment.</p>\n\n<p>\"How about this?  I will work for you for one month at the rate you've offered.  Then, if you don't choose to raise my pay to the level I require, I will quit.

		"Body" : "<p>I am somewhat new to this game, but from my experience, I have found that if the UK buys only infantry the first round, it prevents any possibility from Germany invading UK second turn.  Russia is a tough country to take when a good strategy is implemented, however, if Germany takes most of it quick enough, the allies could be too late.  Keep slowly retreating with the Germans paying for every territory heavily.  Buy only infantry, and mass expensive units in Moscow, counterattacking when the Nazis get to close to the capital.  Try to not let the Germans take ANY of your factories, because then they have to continue producing ONLY out of Germany and West Germany if they don't build any factories along the borders.  If the US can be landing in Africa by turn 3, then landing in Italy turn 5 or 6, the UK can then probably start liberating France.  Once the other allies have started landing units in Europe, start pushing back against the Germans.  Do not try to liberate your territories before the allies have made landings in Europe.  There is no winter in this game, so your Germans will not be destroyed by weather.  The Soviets are not strong enough to push the Germans out of Russia without the Nazis having divert some of their now damaged income to the west.  That's all I got.  Thanks!  I hope this helps! </p>",

		"Title" : "He is making a generalization about the power I offense.  Generally he i...",
		"Body" : "<p>He is making a generalization about the power I offense.  Generally he is right.  </p>\n\n<p>You basically have three pass to run out of this formation for both the fullback and the halfback.  You have a basic side screen, you have variations of an out, and you have up and outs.  I am not going to write a chapter on each of these but can cover the basics:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>side screen.  Against a deep zone this will work but you still have at least 2 DBs lurking in space.  Mainly this would be ran against an undisciplined line crashing upfield too hard.  Against man coverage this would get snuffed out with a good disciplined LB.  Against a Cover 2 or shallow sink variety defense it is low reward because you could have DBs attacking the screen zone.  The biggest problem with the side screen though is the fullback.  Basically you are putting one guy on the field that probably serves no purpose and for most purposes the defensive coach will say ignore (remember that your fast pass catching fullbacks are 1 out of 20).  The extra defender on the field will be a LB with nothing to do.  So he is watching flats and short zones or maybe blitzing.  The example in the other answer talks about Tomlinson/Chargers running the screen game out of the I.  They did a phenomenal job.  But most of the screens were off of play action and they worked because defenses were worried about one of the best runningbacks to play the game.  The screens also worked because LT was arguably a top 10 receiving RB of all time.  He could do anything in any formation.</p></li>\n<li><p>variations of the out.  Really this is probably the most common route out of the I currently.  It gives QB a safety valve.  Often a defense has their LBs read the fullback and runningback on plays.  When LB X is assigned to the FB he reads FB.  When FB represents staying in to block LB blitzes.  When FB goes out for pass, LB X mirrors him.  In almost all cases LB X is more athletic than the FB.  LB Z mirroring the RB might not have a matchup advantage but in most cases he will not be in the negative either.  Again this works well with deep zones.  Man and Cover 2... your RB/FB will get jacked up.</p></li>\n<li><p>up and out.  FB/RB travels straight upfield and then option route (most of the time running an out but sometimes sitting down).  This is a great route.  You are taking away the LBs ability to mirror your RB.  They must attack the pass route with the same finesse and discipline of a DB.  The linebacker is at a big big disadvantage.  This route was the staple route of the greatest show on turf (Rams circa 99-02).  It took a full two years before NFL teams could scheme on how to beat it.  Not only was its design great but they again had a dominant pass catching threat at RB - Marshall Faulk.  They forced teams to zone shallow which puts them in some variation of a Cover 2 and then you have Bruce and Holt running 20 yard ins all day.  But this is a high reward high risk route.  It often takes so much time to develop that the RB never makes it out of the break.  Remember that if he is running the route he isn't pass protecting.  Also this is given that the RB can clear the line.  D-lineman are much more disciplined now at holding the RB (legal or not) as they try to sprint through the line.  This is probably the biggest reason you don't see teams with shifty backs running this variation 10 times a game.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So given the limited route tree, the putting the FB on the field that adds another defender but little threat, and the better disciplined LBs/DL are now (they are just a lot more used to passing where in the 80s power I passing caught them by surprise more) really limits what you can do out of the I.  If you have a tactical I advantage for the run though you can still pass out of the I and some of those might go to your FB/RB but that doesn't mean it was an optimal play.  Really the only way for a team to schematically beat another team with I FB/RB threats is to either have a hall of fame type RB or to have a 1 out of 20 shifty FB.  This is why you have seen so many teams in recent years get rid of FB position or to line up a TE (Miami is an example) and sometimes another RB at FB so that the receiving threat is always there.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>i have come back to post up all the information i can for you.</p>\n\n<p>through the last few months of working with Stratum-mining i have come to some conclusions: you need to know python well to get this working on anything but bitcoin... That being said, its possible to install stratum over a current custom pushpool installation through a project I released and am working on. (Currently it is for freicoin but there are two trivial changes you can make to get my implementation to work on litecoin). There is also another implementation of stratum-mining that you can use that was last updated on Jun 6 2013 (i would suggest using this versus my code if you are installing from scratch or using MMCFE currently. my version of the code is designed to be more friendly to version 2 getblocktemplate, where as litecoin only supports getblocktemplate version 1 at this time).</p>\n\n<p>In the future it may be extremely useful to diff these two implementations as they have different database schemas...</p>\n\n<p>In the mean time,\nHere's how to install stratum-mining-litecoion a NEW system OR a system with MMCFE</p>\n\n<p>step 1) back up your database\nstep 2) back up your database\nstep 3) back up your database</p>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://github.com/Neozonz/stratum-mining-litecoin/blob/master/INSTALL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Neozonz/stratum-mining-litecoin/blob/master/INSTALL</a></p>\n\n<p>\"</p>\n\n<pre><code>> Installation Instructions\n> =========================\n> \n> Step 0. Install litecoind     NOTE: Litecoind currently only supports\n> getblocktemplate version 1. This code was changed to support version\n> 1.    Set it up and start it!     Downloading the blockchain can take a few hours to a couple days!\n> \n> Step 1. Install the stratum core  git pull\n> https://github.com/slush0/stratum.git     sudo easy_install stratum    \n> (or if using alternate python: sudo /usr/local/bin/easy_install\n> stratum)\n> \n> Step 2. Pull a copy of the miner  git pull\n> https://github.com/moopless/stratum-mining-litecoin.git\n> \n> Step 3. Configure the Miner   cp conf/config_sample.py conf/config.py\n>   make your changes to conf/config.py     Make sure you set the values in\n> BASIC SETTINGS! These are how to connect to litecoind       and where\n> your money goes!\n> \n> Step 4. Run the pool  twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -    OR - using\n> alternate python  /usr/local/bin/twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -\n> \n> You can now set the URL on your stratum proxy (or miner that supports\n> stratum) to: http://YOURHOSTNAME:3333\n> \n> Database Setup\n> ========================= Table Creation: Tables are auto-created if they don't exist (I will be adding a schema file later)\n> \n> None: Well, this doesn't do anything, so there is nothing to set up\n> \n> Sqlite: THIS IS THE DEFAULT! Just set the file path in the config file\n> (or keep the default.) Support for sqlite3 is built into recent python\n> versions. A couple notes for Sqlite:\n>   - Sqlite and threading/concurancy just doesn't work right for that reason it is disabled.\n>   - Since threading is disabled, The server will \"pause\" when archiving happens, this will affect         your miners. However this will not happen\n> often (24 hours after finding a share)\n> \n> Postgresql:\n> 1. Set up your parameters in the config file.\n> 2. Install the postgresql libraries in your os:   Redhat and the like:        yum install postgresql-libs postgresql-devel    Ubuntu and the like:\n>       apt-get install postgresql postgresql-devel\n> 3. Install the python bindings    easy_install psycopg2\n> \n> Mysql:\n> 1. Set up your parameters in the config file.\n> 2. Install the mysql libraries in your os:    Redhat and the like:        yum install mysql mysql-devel   Ubuntu and the like:        apt-get install\n> mysql mysql-devel\n> 3. Install the python bindings    easy_install mysql-python\n> 4. Create a database and user.\n> \n> Problems????\n> =========================\n> \n> Is your firewall off? Is litecoin running?\n> \n> TODO: are there other problems?\n\n\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you are already using pushpool and a custom frontend and don't want to write over your system, i have a working (but a bit buggy with MBPM due to the nature of my project) \"install over\" version of stratum mining for freicoin available here <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/joeswhite/joes-stratum-mining-freicoin/src/8eec8a0b11c6?at=master\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitbucket.org/joeswhite/joes-stratum-mining-freicoin/src/8eec8a0b11c6?at=master</a></p>\n\n<p>this is how to install my version (DO NOT INSTALL THIS VERSION UNLESS YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE CODING!), there is an added step for the litecoin implementation but it is not yet tested by me.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"\n\n> stratum-mining Basic implementation of bitcoin mining pool using\n> Stratum mining protocol.

		"Body" : "<p>This is a guest blog post by Lisa Rangel.\nYou, as a job seeker, are continually appalled at the lack of follow-through on the part of potential employers throughout your job search after you have interviewed a number of times.\nYou are reasonable in that you do not expect a \u201Cno thanks\u201D response when sending a resume through an impersonal job posting. However, after going through several rounds of interviews only to receive an eerie silence with no subsequent follow-up, I imagine it leaves you feeling outraged and frustrated. I can\u2019t say I blame you.\nI am a former search firm recruiter and I can tell you that it always makes me sad to hear this. As I 3rd party recruiter, I did experience it, also. I would have candidates going through the process and then the corporate recruiter would go silent.\nAs a former recruiter for 13 years, I wanted to shed some light on what really is happening behind the scenes when a recruiter drops the ball throughout the recruitment and interview process. While it has become a daunting task for employers to manage the communication process, there isn\u2019t an excuse to fail to keep a candidate in progress informed.\nNone of these explanations are to say this behavior is ok\u2026please know that is not my intent. But if you can have an inkling as to what goes on inside these processes, you can realize it is not personal and recruiters are not being sneaky. In most cases, it is just human nature, incompetence, overwhelm or lack of information that is the cause of the lack of response. I find knowing it is not personal can ease the frustration.\nThrough my recruiting experience, this is what I came to realize:\nCorporate HR people and search firm recruiters are middlemen (I know since I was one of them)\nMost are well-intentioned and want to move candidates through the process to get the open job off their desk. To keep the candidate hopeful, the recruiter says things like \u201CI will let you know by Friday\u201D or \u201CI am expecting the manager to get back to ASAP\u201D with full intent on making that happen. Then the manager does not get back to the recruiter, leaving the recruiter in an awkward and frustrated position.\nSome recruiters (corporate and search firm recruiters) can simply manage the process poorly\nThey tend to react to what job process is moving forward and forget about the ones that are stagnant. These recruiters tend to hold all the reigns of communication and, as indicated in the earlier point, set up unrealistic expectations that they will get back with everyone with updates. Many recruiters do not have systems to ensure communication is consistent.\nThe bottom line is most middlemen have little to no control in the process and often make promises they cannot keep. I dealt with this by saying to my candidates when it was applicable, \u201CI hope to hear by Friday, but you have to know I have no control over when they will tell me. If you have not heard from me by Monday or Tuesday the latest, please feel free to check in with me. But know that if I hear anything, I will let you know.\u201D I was honest about what I had control over and did not have control over. Not a perfect solution, I know, but I tried my best. I hated candidates not knowing what was going on.\nHiring managers (or line managers) that are responsible for pulling the trigger typically have no idea that a communication deadline was made to the candidate by a recruiter.\nAnd there are hiring managers that know this, but just frankly do not care. They often do not get back to the corporate recruiters or the third party recruiter that might be in between in a timely fashion.\nLastly, but certainly not least, I have come to learn many people have a hard time:\n1. Giving bad news (the manager chose someone else)\n2. Saying they were wrong (I am sorry that I said I would have any answer for you by tomorrow and now that tomorrow is here and I do not have an answer)\n3. Saying they have no clue what is going on \u201CI must admit the manager said this was a priority, so that is why I communicated urgency to you. I have no idea why they are now not responding on the next step).\nAs a result, I find, with any of these scenarios, many people choose to just avoid it and never make the phone call or send the email and focus on other priority jobs.\nI always suggest to my job search clients to not hold on to the results of the actions they take, to the best of their ability. Just take the actions to move forward during this job search transition (send emails, do follow-up, go to interviews, apply for the job, network, etc) and try not to tie expectations to each result.  When an expectation is tied to a result and that anticipated result not realized, that is where we get frustrated. I do this in my business and in my personal life as much as I can.\nIt is not easy and some days I am not very successful at it. But I find that when I can let go of expectations, I am not often disappointed and I am leaving myself open for other wonderful things to come into my life that I did not even imagine could happen.</p>\n\n<p>this is from <a href=\"http://www.timsstrategy.com/blog/what-really-happens-when-hr-recruiters-dont-follow-up-with-you/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.timsstrategy.com/blog/what-really-happens-when-hr-recruiters-dont-follow-up-with-you/</a></p>",

		"Body" : "<p>These were taken from Sam Storms - [WHY I AM A CONTINUATIONIST]<br><br>\nNew Testament evidence of miraculous gifts among Christians who are not apostles. In other words, numerous non-apostolic men and women, young and old, across the breadth of the Roman Empire consistently exercised these gifts of the Spirit (and Stephen and Philip ministered in the power of signs and wonders). Others aside from the apostles who exercised miraculous gifts include (1) the 70 who were commissioned in Luke 10:9, 19-20; (2) at least 108 people among the 120 who were gathered in the upper room on the day of Pentecost; (3) Stephen (Acts 6-7); (4) Philip (Acts 8); (5) Ananias (Acts 9); (6) church members in Antioch (Acts 13); (7) anonymous converts in Ephesus (Acts 19:6); (8) women at Caesarea (Acts 21:8-9); (9) the unnamed brethren of Galatians 3:5; (10) believers in Rome (Rom. 12:6-8); (11) believers in Corinth (1 Cor. 12-14); and (12) Christians in Thessalonica (1 Thess. 5:19-20).</p>\n\n<p>We must also take note of 1 Corinthians 13:8-12. Here Paul asserts that spiritual gifts will not \"pass away\" (vv. 8-10) until the coming of the \"perfect.\" If the \"perfect\" is indeed the consummation of God's redemptive purposes as expressed in the new heaven and new earth following Christ's return, we can confidently expect him to continue blessing and empowering his church with the gifts until that time.</p>\n\n<p>A similar point is made in Ephesians 4:11-13. There Paul speaks of spiritual gifts (together with the office of apostle)\u2014and in particular the gifts of prophecy, evangelism, pastor, and teacher\u2014as building up of the church \"until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\" (v. 13; italics mine). Since the latter most assuredly has not yet been attained by the church, we can confidently anticipate the presence and power of such gifts until that day arrives.</p>\n\n<p>I could give my person reasoning here, however this is not the site that prompts person view point hence not going by what I have received and seen.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I want to corroborate what chuqui said above and add a bit more detail. Fog works like adding white to all pixels, and it reduces both your sharpness and contrast. Any algorithm that tackles one of these two can be helpful to you. The classics are overall contrast, unsharp mask (try a large radius then a small one) and smart sharpen. But there are also more sophisticated proprietary methods like lightroom's (or camera raw filter's) clarity, capture one's punch, instagram's lux, and most importantly color efex pro's (nik software) tonal and local contrasts. These methods are all based on combinations of those basic algorithms mentioned above, and in my experience work wonderfully in some cases. The reason is that these tools are optimized for improving contrast either only in adjacent pixels or only within specific tonal ranges, and by doing this they boost edge clarity without really driving the overall contrast and saturation off the chart. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, on a subjective note I think the beauty of the shot above lies partially in the smoothness of the fog in it. You may not want to reduce the fog too much. It will make the picture look fake and decontextualized. Fog is your fried there. Play nicely with it and try to get smoothly fading color gradients out of it, while sharpening a little bit. </p>",

For instance, many Canadian and British speakers pronounce the phrase \"none at all\" in a way that others technically hear as \"none a tall\".</p>\n\n<p>If a similar phenomenon were going on with the examples above, we might have phonetic breaks occurring before the [<em>z</em>] in such a way that the consonantal clusters [<em>zg</em>], [<em>zt\u0283</em>], and [<em>zr</em>] would be formed for <em>he's going, she's changing, he's running.</em> </p>\n\n<p>But those clusters don't occur in English at the start of freestanding words.

I keep the rares and mythic rares sorted by colors in a binder (Red, Green, White, Blue, Black, Colorless, Lands, Multicolored - I try to keep the multicolored ones of the same colors together too, like all the RB ones together, etc.) I keep all the rest (commons, uncommons) in boxes divided by color, similar to the binder.  I will make exceptions and pull commonly used cards into the binder that would normally go in a box (like Skullclamp for example).</p>\n\n<p>When I build decks, I usually figure out a theme or mechanic I want to play around and then choose colors that are going to support that.  Recently I've been working on a Golgari themed commander deck.  So I know I need to just worry about cards that are black, green, black and green or colorless.  Therefore I only need to look at those parts of my collection.  Since I can never remember all the cards from all the sets, I will pull those cards out and just look and see what might be viable before I make my final selections.  Keeping the rares separate helps speed this up because they are typically powerful cards that I will want to use in a deck.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately my storage strategy is what makes deck building the easiest for me, since that is what I do most with my collection.  If you trade more and want to be able to find specific cards quickly, my strategy would be horrible.  Best thing I can recommend is to look at what you do with your cards the most and decide how to organize them to make that activity as painless as possible.</p>",

In addition, what you are describing sounds more like custom options for ordered products and not necessarily custom options for the order. </p>\n\n<p>Create your SQL install script:</p>\n\n<pre><code><?php \n/** @var Mage_Eav_Model_Entity_Setup $installer */\n$installer = Mage::getResourceModel('sales/setup','sales_setup'); // Thanks, @benmarks\n$installer->startSetup();\n\n$installer->addAttribute('order', 'size', array('type' => 'text', 'grid' => true, 'input' => 'text'));\n$installer->getConnection()->addColumn($installer->getTable('sales_flat_order'), 'size', 'text');\n\n$installer->endSetup();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is important to note that you need to create both the attribute and the column in the table. If you don't, Magento will not save the values to the table.</p>\n\n<p>When you are ready to set the new value, just load up the model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/** @var Mage_Sales_Model_Order $order **/\n$order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($orderId);\n$order->setSize($value);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will also probably need to display the values on the order page.

It threw the same error before and after doing this. The thing that confuses me is that I looked at my produced PCD files and they seem to be exactly the same as the samples given for NDT.</p>\n\n<p>Mine:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2320 2e50 4344 2076 302e 3720 2d20 506f\n696e 7420 436c 6f75 6420 4461 7461 2066\n696c 6520 666f 726d 6174 0a56 4552 5349\n4f4e 2030 2e37 0a46 4945 4c44 5320 7820\n7920 7a0a 5349 5a45 2034 2034 2034 0a54\n5950 4520 4620 4620 460a 434f 554e 5420\n3120 3120 310a 5749 4454 4820 3634 300a\n4845 4947 4854 2034 3830 0a56 4945 5750\n4f49 4e54 2030 2030 2030 2031 2030 2030\n2030 0a50 4f49 4e54 5320 3330 3732 3030\n0a44 4154 4120 6269 6e61 7279 0a00 00c0\n7f00 00c0 7f00 00c0 7f00 00c0 7f00 00c0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sample from NDT page:</p>\n\n<pre><code>2320 2e50 4344 2076 302e 3720 2d20 506f\n696e 7420 436c 6f75 6420 4461 7461 2066\n696c 6520 666f 726d 6174 0a56 4552 5349\n4f4e 2030 2e37 0a46 4945 4c44 5320 7820\n7920 7a0a 5349 5a45 2034 2034 2034 0a54\n5950 4520 4620 4620 460a 434f 554e 5420\n3120 3120 310a 5749 4454 4820 3131 3235\n3836 0a48 4549 4748 5420 310a 5649 4557\n504f 494e 5420 3020 3020 3020 3120 3020\n3020 300a 504f 494e 5453 2031 3132 3538\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>There is one legitimate question that might be interpreted as \"asking about social life\" but is actually on-topic for an IT interview: asking if you code (or play with hardware such as Raspberry Pi) for fun. Interviewers are often strongly attracted to candidates who code for fun, play with hardware, attend user group meetings, and in general do activities related to their work whenever they can, on their own time.</p>\n\n<p>With this in mind, a question like \"What do you do for fun?\" might not be an invitation to discuss salsa dancing, hot yoga, or 17th century war re-enactments, but a prompt to talk about your personal github repo.</p>\n\n<p>Since the question doesn't include a direct quote I can't know if this was the actual intent of the interviewer. However, it wouldn't hurt to <strong>pretend</strong> it was, whether it was or not. If you are one of those nerdy-geeky-hobby people (like me) then an answer like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I love keeping up with the latest releases even if they're just not ready to use in a work environment. I have a server rack at home running about 25 vms and I'll install those CTPs and other pre-releases the day they come out. I love to see what I'll be working with in a year or two when it's stable enough for real use. I've done some play projects with Arduino too and I'll talk your ear off about those over a coffee any time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>can serve everyone's purposes just fine. Alternatively, if you don't do that kind of stuff after work, try:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I love building software and solving customer's problems and I really throw myself into it at work 100%. I know some people do the same sort of thing evenings and weekends but for me I do better recharging myself with entirely different activities that aren't work-related at all. Monday mornings I'm dying to get back to whatever I was working on when I left Friday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the quite rare case where an interviewer is nervy enough to push further and ask specifically what those activities are, you need to insert a Real.

The car system must request a list of media for it to play (I hope it is clever and doesn't ask for photo's too.) From then on my phone started to heat up and my battery started discharging rapidly. This went on for a few hours, long after I had disconnected the phone from the car. Even turning the phone off and restarting it did not clear it. In the end I just looked for running apps, found two processes being run by media. I closed these and the drain stopped. I reckon what is happening is that media keeps trying to handshake with the USB port (or something like that). Some sort of bug in the program keeps it looping when it should close.</p>",

It is pre-installed, and refreshes every few seconds to provide a dashboard of all open network connections (by process) with their usage. Better than <code>lsof</code> since it shows the usage data too.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ nettop\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then hit 'd' and look for odd-looking entries or entries with consistently large traffic in the 'bytes in' or 'bytes out' column. The 'd' instructs nettop to only show differences in each screen refresh.</p>\n\n<h3>Practical usage notes:</h3>\n\n<p>If you don't recognize the process name, Google it.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want the process around, get the pid (the number next to the process name in nettop), and kill it with <code>kill -9 <pid></code>. If that doesn't solve it, find out if you can uninstall the process.</p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in what the process is transmitting over the network, use the client port number for that particular connection (e.g. '53133' from <code>10.0.0.1:53133->74.125.68.100:80</code>) to run a <a href=\"http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">tcpdump</a>(1) to see the data in the packets being exchanged: <code>sudo tcpdump -nnvvXSs 1514 port 53133</code></p>\n\n<p>If you're interested in the destination the process is talking to, but the destination IP address doesn't have a reverse DNS hostname (like in the previous example), then try visiting that IP address in a web browser as <a href=\"https://IP\">https://IP</a>, click the broken lock icon in the address bar, and view the certificate details to find out which domain is served there (*.google.com in this case). This won't work if SSL port 443 isn't open on the destination.</p>",

		"Title" : "The case for cessationism is in fact not based on any clear witness from...",
		"Body" : "<p>The case for cessationism is in fact not based on any clear witness from Scripture.</p>\n\n<p>It is deemed a doctrine derived from experience, rather than by Biblical study.</p>\n\n<p>The only verse cited for the postulate would be 1 Corinthians 13:8,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; <strong>where there are tongues, they will be stilled;</strong> where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>\n  \n  <p>1 Corinthians 13:8-12</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem with this vwrse is there is no clear consensus that this speaks of today.  Tongues will cease.  When? When the perfect comes.  Typically, this is explained as the canon of Scripture--when the perfect Word of God was given, the miraculous sign gifts ceased, hence toungues, prophecy, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this approach is that it applies its own meaning to the text, and reads it 'eisigetically' into the text.  Compare the three parts--prophecy, tongues, and knowledge.  What this is speaking to is shown in v12, we shall know even as we are fully known.  To those holding cessationist views, this knowledge would be some form of imperfect knowledge.  To a nom-cessationist, this refers to the Eternal state.  To say that 'knowledge' has passed away, however, is not found in this text.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while this is the <em>only</em> verse that even is offered to support the theory, to those opposed, it not held by those who hold different views as a valid interpretation.  Further, as every other major doctrine in the church is supported on the basis of two or more witnesses, this doctrine is only held forth by this one Scripture of questioned interpretation.</p>\n\n<p>Even less Biblical is the case for so called Partial Cessationism.  This view holds that while God yet performs miracles, they are not normative for the church today. Thus, they attempt to circumvent the problem of a single case of evidence of any of the three items disproving the whole thing by declaring its rarity.  In so doing so, they fully abandon the one and only claimed Scriptural tenet they held to.</p>\n\n<p>Remarkably, although he was a cessationist, Charles Spurgeon is recorded to have received prophetic words of knowledge documented in his sermons.  In the course of his preachinf, he was severally moved to rebuke a man in the audience of hidden sin, verified later, of which he had no natural knowledge of.  These cases of supernatural gifting aside, Mr. Spurgeon was a full cessationist.  Unreckognized for what they were, his own gifting appears to have disproved his own doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of tge outcome, however, current cessationists often revert to quoting such as John Calvin who declared that the gifts have ceased.  Proof is left to him as authority, who himself offered no proof, but his mere statement as so is often cited as fact.</p>\n\n<p>It is noted, however, that cessationism is markedly not held by the Catholic tradition.  Part of the propliferarion of the notion of cessationism, then, is in some part linked with through some reformers, in that with the rejection of all things Catholic, they also left the legacy of saints, miracles, prophecies, and visions.  The Catholic church, long having kts recognized saints and so forth, were rejected, and left those apart from it to apparently go quite far in the other direction.</p>\n\n<p>An excellent schollarly article can be found <a href=\"https://bible.org/article/questions-cessationists-should-ask-biblical-examination-cessationism\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><strong>What is the basis for Cessationism?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit were first observed at Pentecost;</p>\n\n<p>Acts 2:16-18  But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;   And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:   And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: </p>\n\n<p>When Jesus gives the \"great commission\" to the eleven disciples, he describes the ability of believers to supernaturally heal others and be immune from harm from snakes and poison;</p>\n\n<p>Mark 16:15-18  And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.   He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.   And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;   They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. </p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note from the Joel prophecy that it includes more than has actually happened so far;</p>\n\n<p>Joel 2:27-32  And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.   And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:   And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.   And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.   The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.  And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call. </p>\n\n<p>Peter had every expectation that everything Joel said was about to be fulfilled. When Jesus began his ministry by quoting Isaiah, he stopped short.</p>\n\n<p>Luke 4:17-20  And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,   The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,  To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.   And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 61:1-6  The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;   To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;   To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.   And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.   And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.   But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.</p>\n\n<p>It might seem that the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit are intended for the Kingdom. They were in evidence when the kingdom was immanent. (Paul was bitten by a snake and unharmed, Peter and Paul healed people including raising the dead, tongues were in use, and devils were being cast out)</p>\n\n<p>There are three main views of spiritual gifts today.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Spiritual gifts are fully functional and available to all Christians today.</li>\n<li>Spiritual gifts are only partially available today.</li>\n<li>Spiritual gifts have ceased functioning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The biggest support for the view that spiritual gifts have ceased to function is empirical. The dead are not raised. Those who support full or partial gifts have to either cling to a distant report of some unverified incident or exaggerate the talent of a teacher or administrator as a \"gift\" from the Holy Spirit.</p>\n\n<p>Prayers are answered. Healing does take place. The Holy Spirit does lead people to have the right words to say at the right time. However, supernatural gifts were not so subtle or transient as to be indiscernible from talents.  </p>\n\n<p>Peter said that the receiving of the Holy Spirit was told by Joel. Joel describes something very much related to Israel and can be considered Kingdom related. If one sees the offer of the Kingdom to Israel as withdrawn at the destruction of the temple or the diaspora, then one might see that the function of supernatural gifts would also be withdrawn.</p>\n\n<p>When a faithful remnant is found in Israel (as described in Revelation), I would expect that the Kingdom would once again be immanent and that the gifts of the Holy Spirit would once again be poured out. I would also expect that the portions of Joel and Isaiah that were expected by Peter and truncated by Jesus would also come to pass.</p>",

So the loops could also be used in logic and even better with a loop vst like battery. </p>\n\n<p>I want to stress first that I am NOT a NI or Logic pro, but in case of the question I think those are better for workflow and tools possibilities just by the fact that they are widely known for their efforts in the music making industry. </p>\n\n<p>And for having more tangibility a NI maschine can do a lot but i costs a lot.   </p>\n\n<p>Do I only used Fruityloops briefly It will bring you basic based loop functionality and that is good.

Both strung with 11-50s because I switch b&f from acoustic quite a bit. Got strat new on a straight across trade for a jazz bass. Bought the tele on a whim cuz I was p/o'd at my then girlfriend!

		"Body" : "<p>For basic organizational purposes, compressing the folders on a per-client basis\u2014or per-project basis\u2014simply makes it easier to reference the material later on. I generally divide up my client work folders between the generic, sundry stuff like notes and invoices. And then have code and related assets in another folder.</p>\n\n<p>I use Mac OS X and what I like to do is create an encrypted disk image using Apple\u2019s built-in \u201CDisk Utility\u201D for each client so I can safely take those files, archive them somewhere and not have to worry about prying eyes checking out file contents. Just create an image that is big enough to hold your files, choose an encrypting method\u2014I use 256-bit AES\u2014and create the disk. Then I store these images on an external hard drive I toss in a closet that is essentially my \u201Ccold storage\u201D for old client work; out of sight and out of mind. With hard drive prices getting cheaper, I have two of these project/client/work drives that are essentially mirrored backup copies of each other; I might not want to deal with these files but if I have to dust them off years down the line I want to make sure the data is recoverable in some way.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of archiving is you ensure that file metadata such as access and modification dates/times are retained. This might not seem like anything significant to you, but perhaps in the future you want to create a nice portfolio of your work and want to make sure you get the timeline right? Well, by having all of the files archived you are assured that none of the files had access or modification time/date stamps mucked around with either accidentally or intentionally. Also on the legal side of things, let\u2019s say something requires you to prove work you did was done a certain date/time? Having an archive with date/time stamps that are frozen you are in better shape when engaging in the nonsense some clients might engage in to blame you for something you might not have done.</p>\n\n<p>Performance-wise, I basically think that keeping unwanted, unneeded files on your \u201Clive system\u201D taking up space is a bad use of resources. My main system disk is about 50GB to 60GB in size. I only ever keep active client work on that. If I were to keep all client projects on my main hard drive, I would have 200GB to 300GB of dead weight just sitting there. Removing it from them main drive makes it easier for me to perform backups of the main hard drive. And it\u2019s made it easier and quicker to recover a backup if my system drive fails.</p>",

If a post is reported directly to the subreddit moderators, we can take action to prevent future misconduct at the subreddit level. We can monitor the offending user, block spammy domains so the user can't create new accounts to continue spamming, etc.  We even have some automation in place that escalates notifications to moderators after a certain number of reports on a post, and automatically removes a post after a much higher threshold.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Users seem to be interested in reporting bad content to <em>somebody</em>, but either don't know the established procedure in our subreddit (trope: <em>nobody <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/all/search?q=%22read%20the%20sidebar%22&sort=relevance&t=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">reads the sidebar</a></em>) or, in the case of spammers, supersede us in favor of the script at /r/spam.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure that there's a solution here that can be applied in a single stroke, but I am interested in changing the culture of our subreddit so that users are encouraged to use the reporting feature.

		"Title" : "Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the w...",
		"Body" : "<p>Well It seems fairly obvious by the way it reads. If you just take the whole thing at face value, then it doesn't start at Romans 6:1, it goes back before that. 6:1 begins with a question based on what he just said, which goes back to chapter 4. Righteousness is imputed by simply believing what God says, not because of what we experience, but in spite of what is experienced (when Abraham was 99 years old and it was impossible to fulfill God's promise, he believed God anyway...in spite of what he saw/experienced, etc.), which takes us back to chapter 3 and imputed righteousness by faith (simply believing God). That then becomes the premise moving forward, faith...not experience, believing God. </p>\n\n<p>You simply believe God and take him at his word. He lists a bunch of good stuff in 5 which we receive by faith, even undoing what Adam brought. So much is this true, so great is our salvation, so sure our justification, that it might be concluded that we can do whatever we want now that we are saved and still be good with God. Hence the beginning of chapter 6...based on everything that has come before it. </p>\n\n<p>The assumption in 6 is that a Christian will not continue in sin because the Christian has been baptized into Christ's body, been put to death with Christ, put in the grave with Christ and has raised again unto new life. He uses the example of two seeds being planted into the ground together. We are challenged to believe this just like Abraham believed God could still produce seed when his body was now dead at 99 years old. He believed God even though it was hard to believe, in fact, it was contrary to his experience. \"He stumbled not at the promises of God, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.\" So should we be, in chapter 6 and believe that God says our flesh is dead and, as a result, we are free from sin.</p>\n\n<p>He finishes out 6 without a shadow of a doubt that the old man is dead, saying three times that we are free from sin. Then he moves into 7 with a statement followed by an analogy. He says, if you are dead (like we are in Romans 6) then we are free from the law. Just like a woman who is married to a mean old man wanted to be free from him but could not break the law. Her old man had to die for her to be free to marry the new man. Notice the law did not die, the old man did. Hence, the old man is dead and we are free from him completely (as the law ends at the grave).</p>\n\n<p>This continues perfectly in past tense language, bringing in the law as an example, using himself before Christ. This goes down to verse 14. Here he switches language to draw a point. What happens when a person tries to please God by the law? This whole argument is about a religious person under the law trying to live up to it, the harder you try the worse it gets, the more guilt you feel for failing. After verse 14 he uses himself in past tense language as if he were still a religious person trying to live up to it, wanting to be free from the power of the flesh (which was put to death in chapter 6). </p>\n\n<p>Why would he do this? Because he was the poster child of good religious guy. This is not Paul currently, this is Paul using past tense language to describe the futility of trying to please God through good works.</p>\n\n<p>In verse 24 and 25, he asks the question, \"who shall deliver me from the BODY of this death?\" he recognizes the problem is the body...the flesh...that thing which was put to death in chapter 6. He answers it... \"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" He did it, the fight is over. </p>\n\n<p>To confirm this interpretation, he continues into chapter 8 with this statement, which would seem strange if Paul, was still in the condition described in chapter 7. He says:</p>\n\n<p>Romans 8:1-8  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. <strong>So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</strong></p>\n\n<p>They that are in the flesh cannot please God! That's the problem with the guy in chapter 7, he was still in the flesh..so he could not please God. But 6, most of 7, and 8 all say that the Christian is not in the flesh. </p>\n\n<p>Now, think about this. If Paul existed, as a Christian, in chapter 7, then he said he could not EVER control himself. In fact, every time he tried to, he failed. He just could not do the right thing! He knew what the right thing was, but he just couldn't do it...ALL THE TIME! \"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.\" Really? Are you that way? Can you never do the right thing?</p>\n\n<p>That is not the prison on death row saying that, that is the Apostle to the gentiles. the writer of most of the books of the NT, the great Paul. </p>\n\n<p>All through the book of Romans he uses the same thought continually. It would be very strange to say that he suddenly switches and contradicts himself for about 10 verses and then goes right back to his original argument. A better thought would be that he simply used language to prove his point that a man outside of Christ who is trying to live up to a law to earn his salvation cannot do it. It is only through Christ that he has hope of pleasing God.</p>",

Wil he consider that you have been in faith because,no,He can never go against his unchanged word in Ephesians chapter 5 which He said that He will present to His father a perfect church,church without wrinkles nor spot.</p>\n\n<p>What Jesus expect from us is that we should stand in the liberty which He had set us free according to apostle paul.</p>\n\n<p>Before we go to christ for forgiveness & salvation there is an old man of sin living in us which the blood of Jesus pursuid it away by force.\nBut the point is that this man left some properties like hatred,lies,fornication,malice,lust,fight,etc in the life of the newly saved person because because the pernetration of Jesus' blood is like fire entering your house in a very hesten way to the devil,you will not wait to take every thing out of the house before you go out but rather save your life.\nBut after every thing,you will go back to the ablazed house because of some properties you left there,though some will be destroyed but some tough ones will still remain.\nThat is why the devil come back to your life to make you sin.for instance,he make you fornicate after giving your life to Christ,it means that he left that very property in your life and now he come back to remind you of it and you fall.</p>\n\n<p>The main truth here is that the presence of christ in you cannot alow the devil to come in again but some of his properties still remain in you.\nYou must not rest after receiving christ fight against those properties in you now so that you will not be denied to enter the kingdom.\nThank you.</p>",

		"Title" : "Paul is speaking to believers who have been exposed to the teachings of ...",
		"Body" : "<p>Paul is speaking to believers who have been exposed to the teachings of the church, which is that selfishness and greed is sin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Luke 16:13-17 NET</strong> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.\u201D\n   The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him. But Jesus said to them, \u201CYou are the ones who justify yourselves in men\u2019s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God\u2019s sight.\n   \u201CThe law and the prophets were in force until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is urged to enter it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tiny stroke of a letter in the law to become void.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If believers confess/agree the above is true, they are no longer \u201Dsinners\u201D.</p>\n\n<p>However, we are saints in bodies of death, bodies that crave to satisfy the natural appetites, sometimes excessively or in the wrong situation. You may want to indulge your love of rich food to the point of gluttony which may be lawfully available with money of your own. Lawful but unrighteous. You may lust after your neighbours property or wife, which are unavailable because of unlawfulness. Unlawful AND unrighteous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>2 Timothy 2:21-22 NET</strong> So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>2 Corinthians 7:1 NET</strong> Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>1 John 2:1-2, 5-10 NET</strong> Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth. But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. (My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous One, and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Original Question</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The gist of Romans 6 is that as Christians, we are dead to sin, and thus free from it. We are no longer slaves to sin, but are slaves to God and righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 6:16-18 (ESV) Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed, and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>Knowing what sin is and its consequences, you are set free. The Pharisees did not even know that their behaviour was sin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>However, I don't think many Christians would say that they feel very free from sin. In fact, Paul goes on in the next chapter to say that he is a slave to sin.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Romans 7:18-19 (ESV) For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This kind of language doesn't sound very \"free\". If he says that Christians are \"slaves of the one whom you obey\", and yet he finds himself obeying the flesh, doesn't that make him a slave to sin? In what way, then, are Christians \"free\" from sin?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Walking in The Light</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scripture tells us that when we believe God wants us to conquer the giants of sin, even though we feel like ants and grasshoppers with regard to being up to the task, He will give us victory. Belief, leads to God giving us the Holy Spirit. Read Galatians 3 for details of what happens when the Spirit is given.</p>",

Must it be approved by the FAA before marketing and sales? Where do I go next?

		"Title" : "Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...\n...",
		"Body" : "<p>Was just reading the similar verse in Luke and was drawn into it too...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. (Luke 19:26, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Luke version appears to add some helpful context, so I suggest reading that chapter.  A few directions that seemed to have some sort of foundation...</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Luke version of the verse comes at the end of parable about the stewardship the nobleman's servants choose while he was away.  10 servants are all given the same amount of money.  When the nobleman returns, he asks what has been done with it.\nOne man traded diligently and turned it into 10.\nAnother turned it into 5.\nBut one stashed it away in fear of the nobleman.\nAt the end, the coin he had kept is taken away from him and given to the one who gained up to 10.</p>\n\n<p>So one thought that comes forward to me is that it may relate to courage\\faith\\understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Because the descriptions in Luke emphasize that the servant did nothing because of his fear.  A fear of the nobleman as much as anything.  Because he is \"austere\" and productive.  Those who had faith went out and used it and got more.  Those who didn't lost what they they had.\nUnderstanding is a bigger picture that may fit because understanding is centered upon fear of the Lord (e.g. Prov 1:7)... which would then really put the Matthew 13:12 into more context coming from:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 11He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. (Mat 13:10-11, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A second avenue of consideration comes from the words introducing the whole parable...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. (Luke 19:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The parable in Luke suggests that the nobleman <em>expected</em> gains from trading.  And his criticism was that the servant could have at least gotten some gain just by putting it in the bank.</p>\n\n<p>Because His point here is that the Kingdom isn't immediately coming, it follows that this is a message to them of what they should be doing going forward.  Not keeping their light hidden, but going forth in service and evangelism as He had displayed to them.  That being fully happy to sit on one's faith feeling secure suggests maybe one doesn't have the faith in Jesus\\God, the repentance of putting oneself first, that such faith would be.</p></li>\n<li><p>A third connection may start in the situation just before the parable in Luke 19, and may have motivated it.  Zacchaeus the tax collector was rich.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. (Luke 19:7, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is given just after Luke 18:18-27, where Jesus speaks of how very hard it is for the rich people to enter Heaven, being harder than passing a camel through the eye of a needle.  So could this verse\\parable also serve to remind us not to look on men by what they have, but by who they are?  That we must be careful not to judge men by their appearance, by who they are financially, but by what they do.  If nothing else, a reminder at least that men of any class can be saved, and does deserve real effort from believers as well.  And in Matthew 13:8, it does echo some of the same leadin, saying some brought forth an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p></li>\n<li><p>And one final connection that really catches me perhaps most...the idea that if you fight to hold onto what you cannot keep (your life), you lose even it.  If you give up your life to Him,  then you life a life with purpose now, and life everlasting to come. I believe Paul or Peter says something very similar to this in one of their letters, but I cannot find it unfortunately.</p>\n\n<p>The servant thinks he has held onto something. He has, by his reasoning, seemingly made himself safe from failure.  But he held onto what was never his to begin with (the coin that the nobleman had given him, in the Luke verse).  Echoed in the verse</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. (Mat 16:25, KJV)</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of the four, the riches connection perhaps makes me the most unsettled.  The support noted in Matthew doesn't seem solid, and nothing else in the surrounding context there seems to supports it.  But maybe the failing is on me to be secured in the message of not judging by appearance that is certainly given other places in the Bible (James 2, John 7, Luke 15, etc).\nBut, all four messages seem to have some support to them.  And perhaps tie together in the end.  But, regardless, I hope I didn't detour your question too much, haven't ENTIRELY talked your ears off, and have added some helpful thoughts.  Thanks for your time :-)</p>",

They infer it based on cookies and such, as far as I understand it, so it's definitely possible that it's not that bad, or that it's worse. It's also worth noting that Quantcast looks at unique visitors to make these estimates, and not, of course, unique <em>posters</em>. One can infer the problem, but realistically I'm looking for more gender-balance in posters, and visitors is simply a side-effect.</p>\n\n<p>I say this all not because I doubt the data, and it is in fact more than lined up with what I've experienced on the site, but I want to make it clear what my evidence is actually supporting.</p>\n\n<h1>Question</h1>\n\n<p>How can I attract more female contributors to the site?</p>\n\n<h1>Hindrances</h1>\n\n<p>As most of us know, women don't currently hold a nearly-fair (not to make this political or anything) power in most businesses, and startups are pretty similar.

I can do that, but I don't know whether that will really raise the percentages or not. I'll probably do it anyway, since marketing is important to us now regardless, but I'd appreciate some way that was a bit less granular than that.</p>",

So in the most of the cases i need to perform a huge logic in the java application for build the correct results.\nIn past I have tested some advices, but in the end i used a lot of HashMap for store in memory the entries retrieved from db and perform the logic I wanted. I was really lucky because the entries were not much for the memory machine.</p>\n\n<p>The question you maybe you think now is: why you need to store all the entries into hashMap?</p>\n\n<p>Example: I have TABLE1 and i need to perform a logic to all the entries. So i have an HashMap with original data taken from db (key: the id of the table, value: the entry POJO) and they can be retrieved by a sequence of queries without load all on memory.\nThe second HashMap contains the modified data sets of the TABLE 1.\nThen I have TABLE 2 to perform another logic but I need the first modified data sets to perform other task. </p>\n\n<p><strong>In the end I must necessarily have in memory all the HashMap that contains the modified data sets for do all the logic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I searched a lot on the internet to see if you can put a caching mechanism, but I am very confused.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What I would need is an intelligent algorithm that saves me the entries of HashMap on disk in case of need, but it should be fast enough to recover data when I need</strong>. Another alternative would be to save the changed data on db and use a massive amount of queries, \nbut I would avoid it because the results that interest me will not be saved to the database</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas would be appreciated, Thank you all!</p>",

There could be some other reasons but it has been my experience that if you have oil in the water you have a serious problem because oil pressure is higher than coolant pressure except with a hot engine that is turned off and in that case you'll have some water in the oil as well but if you have a crack in one or both of the heads above the coolant level (with the engine off) then only a trace amount of moisture will cross over and will usually be evaporated by engine temps.

Suppose that I have a density function $m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, that describes the abundance of some quantity in a vector space $\\Omega = [a,b]^{n}$. Now suppose that the density at each point in vector space changes over time, with a rate that may be dependent on the presence/absence of density at every other point in space</p>\n\n<p>$$\n\\partial_{t}m(\\boldsymbol{x},t) = m(\\boldsymbol{x},t)F(\\boldsymbol{x},?),\n$$</p>\n\n<p>where $F$ might be something like</p>\n\n<p>$$\nF(\\boldsymbol{x},?) = \\int_{\\Omega} m(\\boldsymbol{y},t) k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}) \\; d\\boldsymbol{y}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>i.e. a function of the focal point of interest $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and all other different points $\\boldsymbol{y}$ in vector space, where $k$ is some kind of kernal(?). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong>: \nWhat notation should I use to refer to the state of the system over the whole space? What should replace my question mark in $F(\\boldsymbol{x},?)$, should it be $F(\\boldsymbol{x},m)$, or maybe $F(\\boldsymbol{x},\\Omega)$, or something else? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong>: \nI have an extended part to this question that I'm not even really sure how to explain. Suppose I now have multiple dynamical systems like the one just described, and a second 'higher order' density function $M(?,t)$, that describes the abundance of each dynamical system in some other kind of space. What would the notation for that look like? How would I refer to a particular dynamical system (i.e. the question mark again), what would the space be, etc.? Essentially, I'm interested in whether I could formulate a dynamical equation that is analogous to a hyperbolic PDE, but one in which the flux of the density $M$ is no longer defined by a finite system of ODEs, but by an infinite number of PDEs. </p>\n\n<p>PS I apologise if the first question is stupid, and the second question doesn't make any sense. I don't really have any formal mathematical training, but I'm desperate to get to grips with this kind maths for possible use in my PhD. Any advice or links would be much appreciated. </p>",

		"Title" : "\n  When a program starts it has fixed data structures with fixed data\n\n\n...",
		"Body" : "<blockquote>\n  <p>When a program starts it has fixed data structures with fixed data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a bit of a misconception. It has a fixed form and a fixed set of rewrite rules but these rewrite rules can explode into something much larger. For instance the expression [1..100000000] in Haskell is represented by a very small amount of code but its normal form is massive.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One can't add new data to these structures</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes and no. The purely functional subset of a language like Haskell or ML can't get data from the outside world but any language for practical programming has a mechanism for inserting data from the outside world into the purely functional subset. In Haskell this is done very carefully but in ML you can do this when ever you want.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are no variables in the code</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is pretty much true but don't confuse this with the idea that nothing can be named. You name useful expressions all the time and constantly reuse them. Also both ML and Haskell, every lisp I have tried, and hybrids like scala, all have a means of creating variables. They just are not commonly used. And again the purely functional subsets of such languages don't have them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can merely \"copy\" from the already data or currently calculated\n  data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can preform calcultion by reduction to normal form. The best thing to do is probably to go write programs in a functional language to see how they do in fact preform calculations.</p>\n\n<p>For instance \"sum [1..1000]\" is not a calculation I want to preform but it is quite handily done by Haskell. We gave it a small expression that had meaning to us and haskell gave us out the corresponding number. So it defiantly preforms calculation. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If data structures are supposed to remain as they are (immutable), how the hell does someone add a new item in a list?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You don't add a new item to a list, you create a new list out of the old one. Because the old one can't be mutated it is perfectly safe to use it in the new list, or where ever else you want. Much more data can be safely shared in this schema.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What is the point in having a program that can't get new data? Say you\n  have a sensor attached to your computer that wants to feed data to the\n  program. Would that mean that we can't store the incoming data\n  anywhere?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As far as user input goes, any practical programming language has a way of getting user input. This happens. However there is a fully functional subset of these languages that you write most of your code in and you reap the advantages in this way.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How is functional programming good for machine learning in that case?\n  Since machine learning builds from the assumption of updating the\n  program's \"perception\" of things - thus storing new data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would be the case for active learning but most machine learning I have worked with (I work as a code monkey in a machine learning group and have done so for a few years) has a one time learning process where all the training data is loaded in at once. But for active learning you can't do things 100% purely functionally. You are going to have to read in some data from the outside world.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>At first, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription: In Feynman diagrams we have a lot of Green's functions connected by some rules, the Feynman rules. Actually, the $i \\epsilon$ prescription is more related to the Green's function. The prescription is responsible for a choice in the boundary conditions (asymptotic behaviour). We may put this $i \\epsilon$ inside the expression $(\\omega + i \\epsilon)^2$ or $(\\omega - i \\epsilon)^2$. The first is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Retarded_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">retarded Green's function</a>, the second is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Advanced_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">advanced Green's function</a>.  This choices of boundary condition are related to some adapted Feynman's rules. Calculating things in this prescriptions is not manifest relativistically and not so compact. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagator#Feynman_propagator\" rel=\"nofollow\">Feynman Green's function</a> is the best for doing calculations and very natural.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's be more general. This prescriptions are aroused when we have operators like this:</p>\n\n<p>$$\n(H-E)G(t)=\\delta(t)\n$$</p>\n\n<p>We want to find an expression for $G(t)$. Applying Fourier transform, we can find that</p>\n\n<p>$$\nG(x) = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)} \\int d\\omega \\, \\frac{e^{-ip(t)}}{\\omega - E\\pm i\\varepsilon}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>If you see this function in complex plane, we can se that we have a cut in real axis made by eigenvalues of $H$. The prescription $\\epsilon$ determine how far we pass about the singularity $\\omega=E$. The choice of signal tell in what side.</p>\n\n<p>This precription is simply procedure to getting inverse of operators with real eigenvalues, satisfying some asymptotic behavior. </p>\n\n<p>We can interpret this $\\epsilon$ as a inverse of timelife of the signal describe by the repective Green's funciton. This is because we can identify a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_Breit%E2%80%93Wigner_distribution\" rel=\"nofollow\">relativistic Breit\u2013Wigner distribution</a></p>\n\n<p>The untary is hold because we get $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, so the signal persist at infinite time.</p>\n\n<p>The adiabatic turn on and turn off interaction is another mathematical departure: adiabatic theorem and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_and_Low_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gell-mann and Low theorem</a>, but physically is very close to the $i\\epsilon$. Is a inverse of a caracteristic time that is send to infinity. </p>",

		"Title" : "A redox reaction is any reaction in which oxidation and reduction are oc...",
		"Body" : "<p>A redox reaction is any reaction in which oxidation and reduction are occurring. The word redox is a portmanteau of REDuction-OXidation. So, if we can correctly identify reduction and oxidation, we can identify redox reactants. In practice, this can be a little challenging, so I will focus first on the second part of your questions (definitions) and then go back to the reaction.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ionization is any process that produces ions. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The conversion of a hydrogen atom to a hydrogen ion by loss of an electron is an ionization. \n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\nSo to is the reaction of hydrochloric acid and water, which produces hydronium ions and chloride ions.\n$$\\ce{HCl + H2O -> Cl- + H3O+}$$</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation is a loss of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of hydrogen atoms to hydrogen ions is an oxidation.\n$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So to is the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{2CO + O2 -> 2CO2}$$</p>\n\n<p>Note that this type of reaction is what gave us the word oxidation - compounds are reacting with oxygen and atoms end up with more oxygen atoms bound to them. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reduction is a gain of electrons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The ionization of chlorine atoms to chloride ions is a reduction.</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$</p>\n\n<p>So too is the conversions of acetylene to ethane:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{C2H2 + 2H2 -> C2H6}$$</p>\n\n<p>Not all oxidations and reductions are ionizations. There is a simple mnemonic in English for remembering oxidation and reduction: OIL RIG (Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Oxidation and reduction happen together. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In principle we can write an equation that shows only oxidation:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$</p>\n\n<p>but oxidation cannot happen on its own. That electron that was lost needs to be picked up by something else. This reaction that shows only oxidation is called a \"half-reaction\" and needs to be coupled with a reduction half-reaction to show a valid chemical reaction:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\ce{H -> H+ + e-}$$\n$$\\ce{Cl + e- -> Cl-}$$\n$$\\ce{H + Cl ->HCl}$$</p>\n\n<p>In the other examples I gave, both processes are occurring. In the oxidation of carbon monoxide, the oxygen molecules are being reduced.</p>\n\n<p>The surest way to identify oxidation and reduction (and thus redox) is to compare the oxidation states of the reactants and the products. Determining oxidation states/numbers is more complex that I want to put here, so start with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state#Determining_the_oxidation_state_or_number\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For the carbon monoxide example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>                  reactants    products\nC                 +2           +4\nO (bonded to C)   -2           -2\nO2                0            -2\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The carbon atoms are being oxidized (oxidation number increased) and the oxygen atoms in $\\ce{O2}$ are being reduced (oxidation number decreases). The oxygen atom already attached to carbon did not change its oxidation number.</p>",

		"Title" : "I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe ...",
		"Body" : "<p>I'm not a physicist, rather a simple engineering student, and I believe your confusion has confused me, too. That's great, because it made me look for the answers myself. This is just my personal guess (though grounded in some fact), but it makes a lot of sense to me, and I hope it makes sense to you, too.</p>\n\n<p>Bear with me if this is a long answer.</p>\n\n<p>First off, when we speak of the difference in the amount of electrons just before and just after a resistor, you're right: there is fundamentally no difference in the number of electrons. We know this because all the electrons (current) that comes in must be equal to the number of electrons (current) that comes out. This is one of Kirchoff's laws. Moreover, we know that matter doesn't just disappear and it isn't being converted into energy, either.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the second of Kirchoff's laws tell us that the sum of all the voltages in a circuit must be zero (so, in a simple circuit, the initial voltage from the battery minus all the voltage drops from all the resistors is zero). That tells us that something must already be happening within those resistors that has nothing to do with the battery. So that's a good start.</p>\n\n<p>Then, we should also understand that current and voltage are not the same thing. That is, if you <em>already</em> have a flowing current, that current does not have its own voltage. You might need voltage to jumpstart the flow of current, but once it's already flowing, the current exists as the jumping of one electron across ions, and each electron is only a single point -- it doesn't have voltage because it's only one point. More importantly, current flows uniformly, so there is no voltage that is being generated as it does flow. Whether it is just before or just after the resistor, the current is the same there, and it produces no voltage.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a drawing I made for you:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Z3hH3.png\" alt=\"Drawing of current\"></p>\n\n<p>I drew it as it really is, against the convention. Notice that, despite there being a pre-existing voltage difference between the two batteries, the distribution of electrons is uniform. So, if you tried to take a voltage difference between the first electron and the fourth electron, you get a voltage difference of zero, <em>even if they are flowing</em>, because their distribution will continue being uniform. This, I think, is the equivalent of measuring the voltage across a wire with no resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Because I think it will be useful in analyzing what happens across the resistor, I'd like to point out that the battery is the initial source of voltage. It's made so that one end is much more electronegative than the other, and that one pole has a large supply of electrons whereas the other has a large deficit. So, if you link the two ends together, the electrons flow from the less electronegative end (with more electrons) to the more electronegative end (with less electrons). In the process, the difference in electrons from pole to pole equalizes. Moreover, the chemical reactions happening inside the battery make it so that the poles (anode for negative, cathode for positive) degrade both cathode and anode -- unless it's a rechargeable battery, in which case this reaction is reversible.</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn't quite spell out why there is a voltage drop across the load. If the voltage difference exists between the poles, then shouldn't the same voltage difference exist all throughout the circuit? The answer seems to be yes... but only if there is no load.</p>\n\n<p>So, we have to go back and ask, what is a voltage drop, and where does it come from?</p>\n\n<p>I think your question really is, what happens to the energy at a molecular level? It doesn't just disappear. When the voltage drops, what does it mean? If the same amount of electrons enter the resistor and then leave it, doesn't their energy stay the same?</p>\n\n<p>First, we know that if their energies are the same, then the voltmeter will tell us there is no voltage. We also know that, if their energies are the same, there is no difference between the two points. And finally, if their energies are the same, we know that no energy was lost, and therefore, no work was taken out of the system.</p>\n\n<p>But we <em>do</em> know that work was taken out of the system, and we can see the voltmeter giving us a reading. But if the number of electrons is the same across the resistor, then there <strong>must</strong> be energy being lost. But, where did that energy come from?</p>\n\n<p>We go back to what voltage is -- it is the amount of energy per unit charge. One unit of charge is the electron. So voltage is just the measure of how much energy each electron carries. There are two separate energies in the electron -- its rest energy and its momentum energy. Its rest energy is constant, but its momentum energy is definitely not.</p>\n\n<p>An electron carries energy by its orbital and shell. That is, the more energy an electron has, the higher up it goes into its shell. I think this is because it has more kinetic energy, so it tends to move faster. Moving faster causes it to occupy a larger volume, and so for the nucleus to keep the electron, there must be more pull to keep it in place. I'm imagining it's like the orbit of a planet around the sun, where wider orbits signify more total energy in the system. The orbitals are (I'm guessing, but fairly certain) caused by the discrete nature of energy -- photons are the most irreducible form of energy, so an electron can only jump between orbitals by discrete amounts.</p>\n\n<p>So, inside the battery, the electrons feel a potential difference between the different poles of the battery. This potential difference imparts energy into the electron, causing it to jump to a higher orbital. It then travels through the atoms in the wire until it reaches the resistor.</p>\n\n<p>Inside the resistor, energy is taken out of the electron. The electron jumps to a smaller orbital, and in the process it releases a photon. This release of a photon means it has given off energy. The photon, having energy, is converted to work and waste.</p>\n\n<p>The electrons, now occupying a smaller orbital, exits the resistor with less energy.Because their energy is smaller, their voltage drops. And this, I think, is the reason why it is called a <strong>voltage drop</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This answer raises the question, though -- how does a voltmeter detect this voltage drop, if it occurs in the orbital shells of an atom? And the answer is interesting: it doesn't. At least, not directly.</p>\n\n<p>From what I can read, what voltmeters do is measure the deflection of a pointer against a spring. The pointer, in turn, is moved by the repulsive forces of the electrons on a pivoting wheel inside the voltmeter. And the repulsive forces is, of course, directly proportional to the amount of energy inside the electrons. Because we know the equations of energy, all this is calibrated. What the voltmeter actually measures is not the voltage itself, but rather the force that the voltage difference exerts on the pointer of the voltmeter.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say much more on how the voltmeter works. I'm frankly not so sure if that's true, but I know that the moving current with a certain voltage must work in some way like I just said.</p>\n\n<p>When the electron comes back home to the cathode (because we're thinking in terms of actual electrons moving, rather than the conventional electron holes moving), its voltage will not be zero, but rather will be equal to the energy per eletron in the cathode. Kirchoff's law tells us that at every load, the voltage difference decreases due to the voltage drop. Because the electrons still have energy inside the cathode, this doesn't mean the voltage is zero there (causing electrons to have no energy, which intuitively makes them have no momentum, which can't be true). It just means that the energy when the electron comes back is now the same as the energy at the cathode, so there is no more potential difference and the journey of the electron stops.</p>\n\n<p>If I've made any glaring errors here (and I'm bound to have, as most of this is me guessing and trying to make sense of what I know), please feel free to edit me. And if I mis-explained something, please point out where in a comment, so I and everybody else can see where it's wrong and why. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I realize I used voltage in two ways here: the difference in potential between two points, and the energy per unit charge. One definition requires two points to be defined, whereas one requires only one point.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can reconcile this by imagining that there is the same voltage everywhere. Each electron has exactly the same amount of energy. In such a case, there is no voltage difference. There is no potential difference, meaning there is no gradient which will cause the electrons to move.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess I'm saying, voltage can be a point quantity, whereas the potential difference, or voltage difference, requires two points to be defined. Certainly, this is consistent with the definitions of voltage (and as I remember in class, voltage by itself is a scalar, so it only requires itself to be defined, not another point; the gradient or difference is what requires another point).</p>",

I ask, \"What fraction are red?\" Hopefully someone says $frac{1}{2}$ and we can discuss the misconception.  In terms of how to relate $frac{1}{2}$ to the ratio 1:2 I do it after establishing the equivalence of ratio by scaling up both sides. I want to make green from blue and yellow in the ratio 1:2. I have 2 tins of blue how many yellow? Students often say that's easy just double the tins of yellow because you have doubled the blue. Now I ask them if I had 1000 blue or something like they say 500 but this time because they recognise there are $frac{1}{2}$ the number of blue. A subtle change but one that recognise the proportion of blue and yellow is the same for equivalent ratios. Hope this helps.</p>",

Some particles get loose in this process and burn because of this heat.</p>\n\n<p>From Wikipedia, \"<em>Steel is an alloy of iron, with carbon being the primary alloying element, up to 2.1% by weight. Carbon, other elements, and inclusions within iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements, their form in the steel either as solute elements, or a precipitated phases, retards the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and so weak, and so it controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel.</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Steel gets its strength because of the carbon impurities in its lattice. So obviously, Steel is much more stronger than Iron. Aluminium on the other hand is even softer and lighter than Iron, so there's even lesser friction and hence, lesser sparks. There is also the point about rusting and Aluminium does not rust. Though I am not sure if this is directly related to the production of sparks.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>So, by your definition, you want not just a Ghost, but an Apparition: a Ghost with visible, recognizable humanlike presence.</p>\n\n<p>The XBox story was my first thought, too.</p>\n\n<p>This could indeed be a virtual one, a recording of them as in the XBox story, or even an AI, a learning system that has acquired their skills and behaviors at least in the very specific domain in which it is designed to learn.</p>\n\n<p>In the XBox case, rather than merely driving like they drove on their last lap, a learning system could drive like the drove on average, displaying random of their driving quirks; or could drive as they did at their best <em>on each stage</em> of the race, thus driving better in sum than they ever did in life.</p>\n\n<p>A recorded video of someone, projected, would also work. If holograms are possible, then you have the Star Wars \"Help me, Obi Wan Kenobe, you are my only hope!\" - a ghost of a living person perhaps. Otherwise, you can project onto a wall, or more mysteriously, a stream of smoke, mist, cloud, or water. Could also be a computer-generated sprite texture-mapped with the person's face. Particularly with a low-fidelity projection onto a vague mist, the computer-generatedness would not be so apparent.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other ways to record a person's passing. Perhaps, as they walked from a clearing, they swiped at the thick leaves, and in doing so, either deliberately or accidentally hacked out a person-shaped hole, which, when the sun sets in the evening and shines through it, illuminates the spray from the waterfall. Doesn't even have to be a hole anyone's hacked out - but more likely if done as a deliberate thing. Since the sun moves slowly, you could have it so that only when the light from the sun lit a crystal at a certain angle, it refracted to become a projector - that way you could limit it only to a few minutes, or even a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>One effect I've seen that caused much consternation was headlights over a hill, which, because of the angle of the road, would shine in the back of a ruined house: the house would look lived in, for a moment, and then would fall dark again as the car moved on. Headlights on hilltops have also caused any number of UFO sightings. So, they make good brief-unexplained-lightings. If a picture is briefly lit by headlights passing outside, and the figure in it appears to because the shadows cast on the picture move, that could be a convincing \"ghost\" effect. Lightning could have a similar effect.</p>\n\n<p>Another good effect is a moon-halo. Here's a good trick. When the moon is close to full and dew lies upon the grass, look at your shadow: you will be surrounded by a halo. Tell your friend \"Wow, there's a halo around your shadow!\" (as if you see the halo around <em>his</em> shadow, and not your own) and the odds of him thinking there's something mystical about himself are quite high. When you stand above a mist-covered valley, and your shadow is cast onto the mists below, that has the same effect, writ large. So in this way, someone could be convinced into thinking they see, perhaps, their own ghost, or at least an outline, with a glow from their spirit?</p>\n\n<p>Double-exposure is possible, too: taking shots with a film exposed some years ago that you did not know had already been used to shoot someone else, would show them as ghosts in the shots. Similarly for a videotape with an erase/record head that did not fully wipe the previous data, perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>For more modern digital tech, it would take some kind of software bug - or a virus/malware/joke app that would impose another character into existing video.</p>\n\n<p>In realtime, augmented reality apps like google goggles or yelp's equivalent, let you point your phone at things and see signs for places nearby, etc... what is there was software on your phone that meant, when you pointed your phone camera at something, you say your dead friend superimposed in the shot, or perhaps just their face overlaid over nearby faces that the camera software identified?</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><em>Wow, what a great range of answers! Thanks everyone who has answered so far and I hope to see many more! Here's my take, after a half-day of on-off thought (also set up a few servers in-between):</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uploading</a> never worked. It turned out that creating a new memory-association-chain in a human brain involved a holistic effort by the entire brain, and the complexity of the process defeated the best human minds for centuries on end. All it did manage to create was an abomination, a sad simile, incapable of true consciousness, of genuinely remembering new experiences, or of adapting to new environments. A failure. </p>\n\n<p>With time, a new practice evolved, of decorating the crypts, cemeteries and cities of the dead with these holographic and magnetic-force-field projections of those no longer living, based on such partial uploads. Some were only triggered by specific actions, such as placing flowers in a particular vase in the crypt, or rippling the water in a still, crystal-clear pool, while some only activated on the anniversary of their death. The varieties were endless.</p>\n\n<p>As this became more accepted, and the projections were no longer seen as abominations, the practice grew in scope. After the massive blast that took out the Andromeda Gateway and the surrounding great city of Carston, surviving friends and relatives recreated a distorted, slowly evolving projected replica of the entire city and its millions of inhabitants from records of the town and of the people, all on top of the overgrown ruins. As a monument.</p>\n\n<p>On the <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8453/massive-murderous-destruction-also-manportable\">fierce battlefields</a> of the future, people's life-recorders sometimes survived the blast that killed their owners, and, left on the desolate and temporarily radioactive wastelands, the life-recorders triggered and released a sad and confused ghost, forever retracing their last steps and random fragments of their life. Those with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPE</a> power-plates had a lifetime measured in tens of millennia. </p>\n\n<p>Slowly, as the gap between those embracing technology and those that didn't grew, the daring, the curious, the brave and the restless grew weary of Earth and embarked in <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/9022/how-to-get-across-the-galaxy-moving-slower-than-light-in-a-single-lifetime\">great journeys across space</a>, leaving behinds an ever-more conservative, ever regressing Earth. The <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8866/where-to-anchor-my-space-elevator\">long elevators</a> were torn off their sockets and cast out into space. Things that were once known, were forgotten. The great underground oil, coal and mineral manufacturers trudged on for millenia, undoing the depleting work of many centuries and creating <a href=\"http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/8716/sapience-pulsar-could-intelligence-come-in-waves\">new resources for a new dawn</a>. Eventually even these great machines froze in their tunnels.</p>\n\n<p>The ghosts, however, lived on amid the crypts and ruins of those majestic towns of an age long forgotten.</p>",

Important points: This exercise is very useful for beginners, because they can force them to build up and then possibly move on to the heavier acceleration exercise to a rod or rack. Make sure that you're not swinging backwards back during execution. Do not use momentum during exercise and try to keep your body as straight as possible. With Stiff Legged Deadlift you especially train the back muscles and glutes.

Although the causal link between contaminated hands and infectious disease transmission is one of the best-documented phenomena in clinical science, several factors have recently prompted a reassessment of skin hygiene and its effective practice.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Vita Ultra</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Even with use of antiseptic preparations, which substantially reduce counts of hand flora, no reductions beyond an equilibrium level are attained. The numbers of organisms spread from the hands of nurses who washed frequently with an antimicrobial soap actually increased after a period of time; this increase is associated with declining skin health. In a recent survey, nurses with damaged hands were twice as likely to be colonized with S. hominis, S. aureus, gram-negative bacteria, enterococci, and Candida spp. and had a greater number of species colonizing the hands.</p>",

Put all of that together with the dry ingredients and bake.</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I tried doing something a little bit different. I've been making caramels, so I kind of experimented with my sugar.\nNew Method: Melt sugar until it becomes a syrup, then add hot melted butter until it becomes homogeneous. Add the eggs, chocolate and put them together with the dry ingredients. This time, the batter looked really good. It was nice and thick.</p>\n\n<p>This time the brownies did not become oily. They were good and fudgy.</p>\n\n<p>My question..does anybody melt their sugar before adding the rest of the ingredients in? I know that for Italian meringue and buttercreams, it is a necessity to melt the sugar, but for brownies? I don't know. It worked for me.</p>",

The r and w are the usual read and write permissions.</p>\n\n<p>That's what I use on Ubuntu/Apache, but I believe that it's also possible to do the same with the user (SUID).

The other caveat is that if your drive is mounted with the nosuid flag set, none of this will work.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetocrystalline_anisotropy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnetocrystalline anisotropy</a> is all about spontaneous magnetization. Considere a (single domain) ferromagnetic material. Depending on its crystal structure, its spontaneous magnetization will tend to be aligned with a direction that minimize the interaction energy between magnetic dipoles carried by the atoms contained in one <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">unit cell</a> of the lattice.</p>\n\n<p>That's why, depending on the geometry of the lattice system, you will have different types of magnetic anisotropy : uniaxial (one single easy axe), cubic (2 axes, one easy and one hard), tetragonal, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So far, the most common anisotropy one can meet is the uniaxial one, that is particulary useful for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner%E2%80%93Wohlfarth_model\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stoner-Wohlfarth model</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how about when an external magnetic field is applied? Well, there are two kind of energies in competition : the anisotropy energy which is minimum when the magnetization is along the direction of the easy axis, and the Zeeman energy which is the interaction energy between the magnetization and the external field. This situation is well described by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model and consists basically in minimizing the energy of the ferromagnetic system :\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi)=K\\sin^2\\theta-\\mu_0M_sH\\cos(\\theta-\\phi)\n$$\nThe first term is the anisotropy energy ($\\theta$ being the angle between the easy axis and the magnetization, and $K$ the anisotropy strength), the second correspond to the Zeeman energy ($H$ is the norm of the applied magnetic field and $\\phi$ the angle that it forms with the easy axis).</p>\n\n<p>For convinience, let be $\\phi=\\pi$ fixed as an example. Then the energy $\\mathrm{E}$ has to be minimize according to the variable $\\theta$. In dimensionless units, one have :\n$$\n\\mathrm{e}(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{K}\\,\\mathrm{E}(\\theta,\\phi=\\pi)=\\sin^2\\theta+2h\\cos\\theta\\quad\\text{with}\\quad h=\\frac{\\mu_0M_sH}{2K}\n$$\nOne can easily find the equilibrium states $\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ by computing $\\partial_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})=0$ :\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\equiv\\{0,\\pi,\\theta_h=\\arccos(h)\\}\n$$\nand then study their stability by looking at the sign of the quantity $\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}})$, namely :\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=0)=2(1-h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\pi)=2(1+h)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial^2_\\theta\\,\\mathrm{e}(\\theta=\\theta_h)=2(h^2-1)\n$$\nThe take home message here is that it is possible to change the stability of the different equilibrium solutions by varying the magnitude $H$ of the magnetic field, i.e. by varying $h$. By changing $h$, one can actually <strong>flip</strong> the magnetization from one equilibrium orientation to another.</p>",

Besides appearing randomly, I finally experienced that also when I manually edit my server (VPS) (i.e. adding a domain) it modifies the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file. Only this time it needed a server reboot to have the issue though.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that modification my server directly replies with 'server not found' for every domain installed on the server, including those of clients. I need to manually remove the code it adds to that file- reboot the server and then everything is working properly again. I, of course, want to find the thing causing this problem.</p>\n\n<p>Strangely, the edit to the <code>httpd-vhosts.conf</code> file has nothing to do with the changes made.

		"Body" : "<p>Going in a slightly different direction: don't go overboard. Most small-time prisons probably have a few minor defenses against spellcasters. They'll have their stuff taken, they'll be behind iron bars, if the jailor expects them to be spellcasters he\u00B4ll wear earplugs and hang the key on a 20 pound weight so it can't be Mage Handed and it\u00B4ll probably be dark, which makes vision targeting hard. Other than that; maybe a double set of doors with different keys, so that a single charm won't help, and a number of guards with orders to kill anyone who tries anything funny.</p>\n\n<p>If you go above and beyond this kind of thing for a general kind of prison, then you are basically unfairly targeting wizards. Most Wizards, especially the kind that you'd find in a low-level prison, will be contained by the above. If they try anything funny, they get stabbed to death by the guards. Most would probably not even <em>try</em> to escape. For every guard you charm, there's 5 more with pointy weapons.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: many characters have a glib tongue and can talk their way out of a prison. We don't go around asking \"how do you keep a silver tongued rogue in prison?\". We don't ask \"How do you keep a barbarian who can bend the bars in prison?\", even though they probably can when in a Rage.</p>\n\n<p>If the wizard is high level and in a small-town prison <em>he will be able to escape.</em> So will any other high level character put in that situation; it's not a Wizard problem as much as it's a high level character vs low level challenge problem.</p>\n\n<p>Now of course when it comes to special anti-powerful-wizard-prisons, you can go all out, but those are fantastical locations, not simple buildings designed to hold not so powerful people.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>My favorite way to kill a fly is with a salt fly gun.  (Google those words and you will see what it looks like.)  It looks like a toy shotgun or rifle.  You cock it and when you pull the trigger it blasts a small amount of salt at the fly.  However, if you don't have a fly swatter you might not have a fly gun either.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of how you kill the fly, one thing that may help is to immediately close the door of whatever room you are in. Cutting down on where the fly can go will allow you to kill is more easily.  It is also helpful, if you can shoo in into another room, to pick a room that contains lighter colors.  It is very difficult to see a fly against a dark background.  With the door(s) closed and a clear view of the fly you may then be able to search around for something to hit it with, whether it is a shoe, a rolled up newspaper, or whatever.  If you are feeling adventurous, try killing it with your hands, either by clapping your hands as it flies between them, or batting it out of the air to stun it, and then finish it off before it recovers.</p>\n\n<p>If the fly is on something you don't want to damage (for instance, as vase or trinket), try picking up the object from behind and then moving it towards your hand.  I actually killed a fly like this recently.  The fly won't sense the movement of your hand as easily as your hand is not moving.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Frankly, in the world that 5e has set up it would be difficult at best if you are not using the standard methods of restraining.</p>\n\n<p>Outside of an elite prison built for mages, guards that guard them would need earplugs to avoid any enchantment, and some form of hand/finger restriction would be necessary (manacled to their back with gauntlets that restrict any finger movement). Only the best trained guards in the village or trained animals should guard them (if druids, nix the animals). Trade guards out as frequently as possible to ensure no complacency. Most of the time a mage is unlikely to have Knock memorized, so it is unlikely to be used. Obviously those performing B&E are exceptions as would likely be an Arcane Trickster.</p>\n\n<p>They would, of course, need to be stripped of gear and given prison rags to wear.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, you have most of the ways listed above, but guard quality and restricting their actions when not actively working as slave labor (common among prisoners) would do the trick. </p>\n\n<p>Treat them <em>very</em> badly as well... The paranoid are going to ensure they never get a short rest (if warlocks are common), let alone a long rest. They should be performing demanding physical labor to keep them exhausted, sure. Slap them around a bit. It's a harsh world and those worried about spell casters that actually know about what they can do would take serious precautions.</p>\n\n<p>In FR, it would be easier to find a spellcaster to restrict the inmate than a magic item, so using spell casters to stop them would be helpful, but using a high level caster to stop an entire prison's worth of inmates would be a bit ridiculous.</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, Forest Gnomes are resistant to most of the spells that might cause a guard a direct problem, then they just have to be vigilant.</p>\n\n<p>Understand that when it comes down to it, they can't stop everything and eventually a caster is likely to find a way to escape if they had any memorized/known spells that might help at all and they are tenacious about it. It makes the game more dynamic and interesting when a dedicated criminal can get away with an escape.</p>\n\n<p>The last method is a very quick trial leading to execution for misuse of magic.</p>",

		"Title" : "From Gender in English:\n\n\n  Traditionally ships, even ships named after ...",
		"Body" : "<p>From <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_in_English#Ships\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gender in English</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Traditionally ships, even ships named after men such as USS <em>Barry</em>, countries, and oceans have been referred to using the feminine pronouns. The origins of this practice are not certain - it is not, as is sometimes postulated, a remnant of Old English's grammatical gender (in Old English, a ship, or \"scip\", was neuter, and a boat, or \"b\u0101t\", was masculine).<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>It is currently in decline (though still more common for ships, particularly in nautical usage, than for countries), and in Modern English, calling objects \"she\" is an optional figure of speech, while in American English it is advised against by <em>The Chicago Manual of Style</em>.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have also heard vehicles other than ships personified and feminized, though this is as often as not done derisively \u2013 for when a man spends so much time working on or driving a treasured car that it is referred to as his girlfriend or wife, and so is a <em>she</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But in all cases, this is not <strong>grammatical</strong> gender, it is supposed to be the <strong>actual</strong> gender of the thing that you're referring to. \"Man\" isn't a \"masculine noun,\" it's a \"noun which refers to a male.\" Even in cases where <em>she</em> or <em>her</em> are applied to inanimate objects, that is because those are objects are being <strong>personified</strong> and <strong>feminized</strong>,  not because the nouns themselves are in any way feminine. When, say, \"liberty\" is referred to with <em>she</em>, the speaker is referring to some \"Lady Liberty,\" liberty incarnate in the form of a woman (and sometimes, Lady Liberty might <em>literally</em> be a woman in a work).</p>\n\n<p>Grammatically, <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> can be swapped at will, and it will not cause a sentence to become ungrammatical \u2013 just confusing because it will be difficult to be sure to whom the pronoun refers. English has no grammatical gender.</p>",

First, I name a temporary file for holding the script where <code>$$</code> is the process ID of the shell running this script. The <code>/tmp/something.$$</code> metaphor is used in case two instances of this script are run at the same time, they won't try to use the same temporary file.</p>\n\n<p>The variable <code>$SHELL</code> is set to the name of the shell running the script. If you use /usr/bin/bash, presumably you'd like the mini-script to use it also. </p>\n\n<p>The <code>\"$@\"</code> is a shell idiom for \"interpolate all my arguments, quoting them if needed\". This peculiar syntax causes</p>\n\n<pre><code>script.sh 'my file' your\\ file\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to interpolate the arguments as two elements</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my file\" \"your file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of the four that <code>$@</code> would yield</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"my\" \"file\" \"your\" \"file\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The last lines of the script arrange for a gnome-terminal to start running the mini-script and then starting an interactive shell. When the gnome-terminal exits, the temporary script is removed because littering is uncool.</p>\n\n<p>The last line is not a part of the mini-script, it demonstrates that the mini-script works. If the 11 line script above is in a file called <code>rt.sh</code> then the <code>chmod</code> makes it executable and then it is executed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ chmod +x rt.sh && ./rt.sh echo hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result of all of this will be a gnome terminal which starts up, displays</p>\n\n<pre><code>hello world\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on its first line and then starts an interactive shell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>msw@myhost:~$\n</code></pre>",

I seriously think the focus on BOTH questions is wrong; You need to fix your user problem, not the server filesystem problem. </p>\n\n<p>Honestly, given how crucial this filesystem is to the basic functionality of the machine, your best bet is to get out of thinking about this problem like a sys admin and start thinking about it like a manager. </p>\n\n<p>In other words: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Teach your users how to properly reboot this system to prevent the /var corruption problem to begin with. Documentation is your friend as they say. This is not an ideal solution for multiple reasons but at least it keeps them from frying filesystems. If nothing else, they shouldn't be touching the damn thing at all if it's your job to keep it running. </li>\n<li>Lock it away where they can't get to it. Seriously, if this is a server storing important data why is this not already the case? Is this a development system and the developers just don't know what they're doing or how damaging this can be ?? If so, again, teach them. It's not your job to fix stupid, it's your job to prevent stupid. </li>\n<li>Tell them to leave it the hell alone and come talk to you if there's problems. :)</li>\n<li>Lo-tech, but possibly helpful (though a fire hazard to be sure): Duct tape the shit out of both ends of the power cable so they have to spend 15 minutes trying to untape it. Hopefully, after five minutes and on layer 26 of tape they'll get frustrated and do what they're supposed to do: Talk to you to fix the actual problem that's motivating them to pull the plug in the first place. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What is it about this machine that makes it so unstable they think it's necessary to reboot it ?? It's a debian system. They don't need \"reboots\", so what else is wrong with it ?? Are they worried about power consumption or are there services that are broken and unstable on it that only a reboot can solve ? If it's the latter, then your question is irrelevant and you have other work to do, sorry to say. </p>\n\n<p>If nothing else, you could approach your suggestion to be good to it and not reboot by pulling the cable as an exercise in energy conservation. Do you really want to get up from your desk to pull a power cable rather than just sit there, login, and reboot it on the command line ?? It takes like 2 seconds of work to do it that way, versus getting up, grumbling the entire time all the way to the device, yank the cable, plug it back in, wait for it to come back up broken, and then have to wait even longer for /var to be fscked. </p>\n\n<p>The get up-yank cable-wait for /var to fix it self cycle takes far longer, is far more complex to maintain in the long run, will cause all kinds of pain on your part, has already motivated you to ask the wrong questions, and will ultimately lead to you at the top of a bell tower with a love weapon and a death wish. </p>\n\n<p>Fix it right, by fixing your users or mitigate the damage by making it extremely challenging for them to accomplish stupid. I can't be more clear on the importance of this. </p>",

		"Body" : "<p>Good question. </p>\n\n<p>In the context of the first few chapters of Proverbs, the compiler of the proverbs makes it very clear the book had its genesis in the throne room of Israel. Picture King David  carving out some quality time with one of his children, Solomon, for the express purpose of teaching his son some of the lessons he has learned over the years. David, you'll recall, was a \"man after God's own heart\" (Acts 13:22; 1 Sam 13:14), and he learned many things in his relationship with his God, some the hard way. </p>\n\n<p>David's purpose, then, was to instill in his son Solomon the godly principles which would guide and guard him throughout his life and his future reign as king of Israel. The pithy and memorably constructed proverbs of the day served to encapsulate important life-lessons in short, relatively easy-to-memorize stanzas. </p>\n\n<p>Historically, at about the same time as Solomon was composing, <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Ecclesiastes+12\" rel=\"nofollow\">pondering, searching out, and arranging many proverbs (perhaps 3000 or more</a>), Amenemope had already written his <em>The Wisdom of Amenemope</em>, a collection of teachings in proverb form on civil service, which may have predated Solomon's collection of proverbs. Some of Solomon's proverbs bear a striking resemblance to some of Amenemope's aphorisms (see the <em>NAS Bible, Updated Edition</em>, Introduction to Proverbs, under \"Author\"). These \"family resemblances\" suggest Solomon searched all the proverbs to which he had access in his day and \"cherry picked\" the ones which suited his purposes (and God's purposes, of course!)  </p>\n\n<p>Since an important theme of the entire book is sexual morality and the importance of young people (particularly the male of the species; i.e., guys) keeping their lives free from the polluting effects of unprincipled and unbridled sexual activity, Solomon chose a woman to personify wisdom to serve as a righteous counterpart to the \"immoral woman\" who appears and reappears throughout the book. She is alternately labeled \"the evil woman,\" \"an adventuress,\" the \"flattering foreigner,\" an \"adulteress,\" and perhaps many other titles, depending on which version of Proverbs you happen to read. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, the <strong>evil woman</strong> serves as a foil** for the <strong>woman who is wisdom personified</strong>. Or, they act as foils for one another, as the contrast between the two serves to clarify the differences between them. One woman, for example, is out to bring a young man to ruin, whereas the other woman has only his best long-term interests at heart. One represents immediate gratification followed by regrettable consequences, and the other, delayed gratification followed by gifts that keep on giving. Contrast, for example, the adulteress who is mentioned throughout the book with another woman, this time <strong>the virtuous woman</strong>, who is described in detail in chapter 31!</p>\n\n<p>Was the personification of virtues a common feature of literature in Solomon's day? Frankly, I do not know. I will leave the answer to that question to another contributor who desires to research it. I will say, however, the Scripture does use \"stock characters\" who serve in pedagogical/analogical fashion to drive home some hortatory content (e.g., the \"story\" of two women--again!!--called Oholibah and Ohola, in Ezekiel 23). </p>\n\n<p>Female imagery is used in both positive and negative ways throughout the Scripture. Positively there are both the woman Wisdom who lifts up her voice in Proverbs 8 and the \"virtuous woman\" in Proverbs 31, and negatively there are both the Great Harlot (or \"Babylon the Great,\" of John's Revelation of Jesus Christ), and the </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"woman clothed with the sun, [with] the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars . . . who gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . . .\" (Rev 12:1,5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Great Harlot serves as a foil for the pregnant woman who gives birth to a son.</p>\n\n<p>Solomon's choice of a woman to serve as wisdom personified may have been his own invention, or perhaps he borrowed the concept from Amenemope or another writer either from or before his time. <em>That</em> he used a woman for his pedagogical purposes is certainly consistent with other such rhetorical tactics in Scripture, as I have already pointed out. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, you will notice I have connected the woman wisdom to other personifications which use women to communicate certain truths, and I have done so purposely, in part, to avoid eisegesis. While your question focuses on the Book of Proverbs, the Scripture comprises 66 books, and more than occasionally the imagery which is used in one book or context is also used in another book or context, giving the Scripture a marvelous unity amidst diversity. That fact, however, is one which is worthy of development, albeit at another time.  </p>\n\n<p>**For an interesting (and short) article on the use of foils, see this <a href=\"http://characterandcharacterization.webs.com/foil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">web page</a>.</p>",

You see, we always expect everything to be as we like it. We want to have control over all around us, even nature. In Christian theology, the earth is at the center of the universe. Our inherent conception is that we occupy a central, priveleged position in everything we do, from relationships to businesses to our understanding of the universe. The reality is that we are anything but priveleged. Science has repeatedly shattered this misconception of ours, but we still hang on to the ego. I suggest you watch Carl Sagan's famous speech <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZRF6zNoc\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Pale Blue Dot</em></a> which puts accross this message so powerfully. </p>\n\n<p>In such a case, I think it is extremely unfair to expect the speed of light have a value that appeals to us, other than $c$, the universal speed limit. In your case, the question is not about why the speed of light has that particular value, but why we think it is not supposed to be so.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>I want to tell the story from the designer perspective and I totally agree with <a href=\"http://sound.stackexchange.com/a/34272/12636\">Rene's answer</a>. I do sound design for video games. I <em>always</em> prefer non-edited files even if they require some extra work.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I find a very nice sound to fit my project but disappointed to see it was ruined because somebody assumed that it is better to add some fancy FX so that the sound would fit some genre in their mind (not mine) perfectly and everybody will love their SFX library. So I'm left with an \"if it was unedited it would be very useful sound\" with a strange reverb and 3 seconds of fade out on it.</p>\n\n<p>Let's check what the <em>Library Producer</em> <a href=\"http://sound.stackexchange.com/a/34272/12636\">says</a> about that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't have context. I'm giving you all of the clean sound that was in the air in that moment, and relying on you to use that sound as you see fit in your project. If I were to do a fade that I might like, you'd be cursing me for that the moment my fade didn't match your context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you do a lot of sound design work you get used to and small clean up requires just a little effort which definitely worths rather than searching for a similar sound although you already have the ruined version of a perfect fit.</p>\n\n<p>I think edited libraries are mostly fast-food libraries for people looking for some quick work that doesn't need or doesn't have budget for a sound design job.</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>No, Jesus did not subject Himself to the law of the land by paying the temple tax. </p>\n\n<p>For one thing, the temple tax (see Exodus 30:12 ff.) was <em>not</em> a law of the land, but it was a law of Moses imposed on the \"sons of Israel\" both as a ransom for them and for the maintenance of the \"tent of meeting\" (i.e., the tabernacle).</p>\n\n<p>By paying the temple tax Jesus was avoiding unnecessary controversy and at the same time not offending the collectors of the tax, who were within their rights to do so (again, see Exodus 30:12 ff.). </p>\n\n<p>We do well, however, to follow Jesus' line of reasoning for doing so, and the logic he used with impetuous Peter who took it upon himself to speak for Jesus when asked if his teacher (i.e., Jesus) paid the two-drachma tax. <a href=\"https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Matthew+17\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is what Constable says about this passage:</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Jesus turned this inquiry from the tax collector into a teaching situation for Peter and presumably the other disciples. Jesus changed the tax from a religious one to a civil one to make His point clearer. The principle is the same in both cases, but it was easier to illustrate in the civil arena of life.</p>\n  \n  <p>Jesus\u2019 point was that [just] as the sons of kings are exempt from the taxes their fathers impose, . . . He [too] was exempt from the taxes His Father imposed. He meant the temple tax. The temple really belonged to God (Mal. 3:1). Jesus was teaching Peter the implications of His deity. <em>He was not teaching Peter to fulfill his civic responsibility</em> [my italics].</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Even though He was exempt, Jesus would pay the tax because He did not want to offend anyone needlessly (cf. 5:29). Failure to pay the tax would create unnecessary problems. Because Peter was one of Jesus\u2019 disciples and one of God\u2019s children through faith in Jesus, he also had no obligation to pay the temple tax (cf. 12:1-8) . . .. Since the sons of God are exempt from maintaining the temple and its service, the end of this system of worship appeared to be approaching, as it was. Here is another indication that Jesus ended the Mosaic Law (15:11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus' paying of the temple tax for both himself and Peter was not an instance of Jesus subjecting himself to any law, whether imposed by the state or by God through Moses for Israel. Rather, paying the tax was a teaching opportunity through which he taught his disciples about his deity and specifically about his relationship to the Law and to the Law Giver. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is said that no one is above the law. No one, that is, except the Law Giver.  Some of Jesus' most memorable words began with the phrase, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You have heard that it was said, . . .. But I say unto you . . ..\" (see Matthew 5:21 ff.), </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and yet, the same Jesus also said, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Do not think I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill\" (Matthew 5:17 NASB Updated). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Christians thank God that though Jesus was above the Law, he also came to fulfill it perfectly for those of us who could not.  </p>",

		"Title" : "Design a system for real time events delivery",
		"Body" : "<p>Please share your thoughts over this designing question (If you need any more info, pls. do let me know): GIVEN: Let's say we have a popular eCommerce site with lots of sellers and millions of products. The system has a CatalogManager Service which is being called by various seller platforms to update info (attributes) about seller and it's products. For e.g. Seller can say 'Hey, my brand name has changed to New_Brand', 'Hey, My Product P1 weight has changed to 6kg'. The catalog manager service has it's own datastore and cache in place where it goes and update accordingly. Imagine the sclae of these update requests to be very high as we have thousands of sellers and millions of products and each may have 50-60 attributes which could be chaned. The CatalogManager service is able to handle all these updates smartly.</p>\n\n<p>TO DESIGN: There are various other back-end services (ShippingService, SearchService) in the system who must me notified about these changes in REAL TIME. For e.g. ShippingService must be notified by CatalogManager that 'Hey, Product P1 of seller S1 weight has changed to 6 kg'.

		"Body" : "<p>From what I understand, unless such as in the 3.5e example where the cantrip or spell specifially says the cantrip or spell can be executed in conjunction with an attack, that itself IS an attack or action.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if you read the 3.5e version of the cantrip you posted, it says you do a <strong>melee touch attack</strong> to do the fire damage, it does <strong>NOT</strong> mention doing the damage in addition to any bludgeoning damage from a martial arts unarmed attack for instance. So I think it's either/or and cannot be combined, you have to choose which one you are performing.</p>\n\n<p>In 5e, an unarmed attack is undescribed (except perhaps by the player flourishing his action with story telling). The monk could be hitting with a open hand, fist, elbow, knee, head, kick, or <strong>EVEN</strong> with weapons that qualify as monk's weapons (simple weapons). You'd be hard pressed to explain how the flame traveled from the palm of your hand along the shaft of the staff.</p>\n\n<p>Then again, mages can use staffs, rods and wands in touch attacks can't they? I don't have a ready reference to check that for 5e. There is a discussion here <a href=\"http://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/46704/can-the-arcane-druidic-focus-staff-double-as-quarterstaff\">Can the Arcane Staff Double as a Quarter Staff</a> about this particular question. It's a bit more broad than your specific question, but may just be part the answer you are looking for by answering whether a staff can double as a quarter staff and THUS be treated for touch when part of an unarmed attack sequence. I don't think it will grant additional damage, but it COULD allow your cantrip to cause 1-6 fire damage rather than 1d4 bludgeoning. I think that would still have questionable effect though since the amount of damage is rather comparable once all bonuses are taken into account, the principle difference being between bludgeoning vs fire damage. I also still don't have my PHB with me, but monks get a elemental discipline called something like <strong>Fangs of the Fire Snake</strong> or something like that that grants 10 ft reach and 1d10 fire damage <strong>in addition to</strong> your bludgeoning damage.</p>\n\n<p>I'll update that monk discipline later when I get home.\nEDIT: Updated Discipline</p>",

		"Body" : "<p>You should pay attention to your singing.</p>\n\n<p>Tone-deafness is a result of a disconnection between what are you hear and what you produce. It is generally fixable through conscious attention.</p>\n\n<p>I work developing musical training computer games for children.</p>\n\n<p>My mother sang to me as a child, and she is tone-deaf. I also learned to sing in a tone deaf manner. We learn by copying.</p>\n\n<p>I subsequently spent thousands of hours playing the piano, but my early training (basically to NOT pay attention to the sounds I am making) retarded my musical development. That caused me much suffering.</p>\n\n<p>It was only in my 30s that I trained myself consciously to sing correctly, it has been hard work. I taught myself to sing accurately using a solfege system.</p>\n\n<p>I fixed such things as gradual pitch drift, incorrect intervals such as getting a fourth, fifth, octave muddled up, squashed thirds.</p>\n\n<p>It is a blessing for your child that you are conscious enough to enquire.</p>\n\n<p>You should find your child a teacher, who can teach them to sing. This should be the first instrument everyone learns upon, it is our natural inbuilt instrument. To try and bypass it is stupid. Chopin said <strong><em>\"If you wish to play, you must first learn to sing.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>If your child has a teacher, you don't need to worry about damaging their musicality.</p>\n\n<p>If the child doesn't, you do. Even by abstaining from singing, your child will learn to perceive the world as you do by a million subtle cues. The way you use words, the way your eyes will move, the way your physical form follows conscious intent. And the set of conditions that led to your own disconnection may well be transferred to the child. Maybe you are primarily a visual person, this is your primary perception and the root of your attention. It's quite easy to see if someone is primarily a visual person. The renowned 19th century music teacher Evelyn Fletcher Copp (the first teacher to systematically impart Absolute Pitch to her child students) said that when a parent brought a prospective new student to see her, she would look closely and ascertain how the child perceives the world (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, logical, emotional, etc).</p>\n\n<p>It's worth remembering that these balances can be adjusted. Imbalance can show proclivity which is to be encouraged. But at the same time weaknesses should be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>If someone is strongly primarily visual, maybe practising music in a pitch dark room would encourage them to rebalance.</p>",

But for us programmer types who have to do sysadmin stuff out of necessity here's what was going on.</p>\n\n<p>Short answer: My MAC address was incorrect in my /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192 configuration.</p>\n\n<p>Long explanation: VMware generates a new mac address for each new virtual nic when you provision a new VM from a template. Seems reasonable. But when you look at the hardware address configured in the VMWare setting it only shows you the first four octet in a disabled text box that will not allow you to see the rest. My mac address in the configuration seemed to have the same first four octets so I assumed incorrectly that the mac address in the config was correct. After shutting down the VM, I could scroll to the right and see the rest of the mac address. Upon noticing it was different, I changed it in my config and everything worked.</p>\n\n<p>If Redhat devs read this site, please put some meaningful error messages when things like this go wrong.

		"Body" : "<p>We are using Windows Backup on SBS 2008 SP2 and backing up to 1TB external hard drives. Recently after switching drives our backup started failing because the backup drive is full and auto-delete isn't automatically deleting older backups/show copies. I'm trying to get more information to help me effectively prevent this problem from reoccurring in the future.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How I can tell that the drive is getting full:</strong><br>\nIn the event viewer under Windows Logs > Application, I'm seeing Event ID 517 but it fails to show an intelligible description. However, under Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Backup > Operational, I'm seeing an event with the ID of 5 and a description like this: Backup started at '10/4/2011 12:30:12 PM' failed with following error code '2147942512'.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most informative posts I've found on this error is located on Microsoft's Technet Forums <a href=\"http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsbackup/thread/c55e4e16-22af-4d84-b2c4-7aedcf512469\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. In that post, a Microsoft representative gives this hazy explanation:</p>\n\n<p><em>auto-delete feature to ensure that at least some old backup copies are maintained on the disk -- does not automatically delete backups if space utilization by older copies is less than 1/8 of the disk size or in other words, 13% of the disk size. that means if the one full backup copy does not fit in the 7/8 of the disk size, backup may fail with disk full error. auto-delete will not automatically delete older versions to reclaim more older versions of backup.</em></p>\n\n<p>In the above explanation, I do not understand what is meant by \"older copies\" except that it appears that anything older than the very last shadow copy would be considered \"older copies\". I'm going to make the assumption that this problem where auto-delete will not work will affect any hard drive that is large enough to make an effective backup drive, or in other words, any hard drive that is large enough to hold more than one backup/shadow copy at once.</p>\n\n<p>The same MS representative proposes the solution of using a larger backup drive. I can't understand how this will help. It appears to me it will simply delay the problem until a later date.</p>\n\n<p>In order to resolve this problem for now, I did the following: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Assign the backup drive a disk letter under disk management. </li>\n<li>Run the command line with Administrative rights.</li>\n<li><em><strong>diskshadow.exe</strong></em> [enter]</li>\n<li><em><strong>delete shadows oldest x:</strong></em> [enter] (where X: is the letter you\nassigned your backup drive)</li>\n<li>I manually ran the above command some 60 or 80 times to free up about 200 GB of space on my 1 Terrabyte External Hard drive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However, I do not feel this is a satisfactory solution to prevent the problem from happening again in the future. <strong>Does anyone have a solution to prevent your Windows Server backup drive from getting full?</strong></p>",
